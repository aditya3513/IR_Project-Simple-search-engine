NEATER2: A PLI Source Statement Reformatter NEATER2 accepts a PLI source program and operates on it to produce a reformatted version When in the LOGICAL mode NEATER2 indicates the logical structure of the source program in the indentation pattern of its output Logic errors discovered through NEATER2 logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible through compilation and trial runs A number of options are available to give the user full control over the output format and to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early stages of development of a PLI source deck One option USAGE causes NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded during execution This feature is expected to provide a major aid in optimization of PLI programs CACM November 1970 Conrow K Smith R G logical analysis of PLI source reformatting of PLI source documentation aid execution time usage data 1.52 4.12 4.19 4.42 CA701104 JB February 10 1978 8:40 AM 1974 5 1974 1974 5 1974 1974 5 1974 2971 5 1974 1835 6 1974 1974 6 1974 2534 6 1974
