On Accurate Floating-Point Summation The accumulation of floating-point sums is considered on a computer which performs t-digit base B floating-point addition with exponents in the rangem to M An algorithm is given for accurately summing N t-digit floating-point numbers Each of these N numbers is split into q parts forming qN t-digit floating-point numbers Each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit accumulators Finally the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum In all qNn-1 t-digit floating-point additions are performed Under usual conditions the relative error in the computed sum is at most B^1-t for some v Further with an additional qn-1 t-digit additions the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy For example for the IBM360 B=16 t=14 M=63 m=64 typical values for q and n are q=2 and n=32In this case becomes N <= 32768 and we have B^1-t = 4x16^-13CACM November 1971 Malcolm M A floating-point summation error analysis 5.11 5.19 CA711105 JB February 2 1978 10:48 AM 1328 4 2144 1333 4 2144 2144 4 2144 1052 5 2144 2144 5 2144 2144 5 2144 2144 5 2144
