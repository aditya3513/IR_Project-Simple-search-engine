Gauss Harmonic Interpolation Formulas Let R be an open bounded simply connected region in the xy-plane and let xy be a point in R Assuming R is starlike with respect to xy we discuss a method for computing Gauss harmonic interpolation formulas for R and the point xy Such formulas approximate a harmonic function at xy in terms of a linear combination of its values at certain selected points on the boundary of R Such formulas are useful for approximating the solution of the Dirichlet problem for R CACM August 1974 Stroud A H interpolation quadrature harmonic interpolation harmonic quadrature Dirichlet problem 5.13 5.16 5.17 CA740814 JB January 17 1978 9:23 AM 2610 5 2610 2610 5 2610 2610 5 2610
