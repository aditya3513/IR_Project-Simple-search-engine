Solution of Transcendental Equations by Series Reversion An algorithm is developed for expressing the solution Y of the equation FY = GX as a power series in X X0 when f and g are given as power seriesand the root Y0 is known at Y=X0The algorithm is illustrated for the equation Y^Y = X ie 1+yln1+y = ln1+x CACM January 1966 Thacher Jr H C CA660102 JB March 3 1978 4:27 PM 1495 4 1495 1494 5 1495 1495 5 1495 1495 5 1495 1495 5 1495 1495 6 1495
