Merging with Parallel Processors Consider two linearly ordered sets A B |A|=m |B|=n m<=n and p p<=m parallel processors working synchronously The paper presents an algorithm for merging A and B with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2+ [log2 nm] steps If n = 2^Bm B an integer the algorithm requires at most 2+ 2+B steps In the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude ie n=km with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2+ 3+k steps These performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm Batchers algorithm which requires np mn2plog2 m steps in the general case and kmp k+12mplog2 m in the special case where n=km CACM October 1975 Gavril F parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 CA751005 JB January 6 1978 10:50 AM 2714 4 2714 3075 4 2714 2664 5 2714 2714 5 2714 2714 5 2714 2714 5 2714 3075 5 2714 2289 6 2714 2557 6 2714 2664 6 2714 2714 6 2714
