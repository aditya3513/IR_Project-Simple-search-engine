Models for Parallel Processing WIthin Programs Application to CPUIO and IOIO Overlap Approximate queueing models for internal parallel processing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed system are developed in this paper The solution technique is developed by network decomposition The models are formulated in terms of CPUIO and IOIO overlap and applied to the analysis of these problems The percentage performance improvement from CPUIO overlap is found to be greatest for systems which are in approximate CPUIO utilization balance and for low degrees of multiprogramming The percentage improvement from IOIO overlap is found to be greatest for systemtems in which the IO system is more utilized than the CPU CACM October 1978 Towsley D Chandy K Browne J Multiprogramming parallel processing queueing network models multiprocessing of computation and IO 4.32 8.1 CA781002 DH January 29 1979 6:23 PM 3059 4 3059 3070 4 3059 1685 5 3059 2988 5 3059 3059 5 3059 3059 5 3059 3059 5 3059 3059 6 3059
