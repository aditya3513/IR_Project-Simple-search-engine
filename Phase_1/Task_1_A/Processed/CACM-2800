Connections Between Accuracy and Stability Properties of Linear Multistep Formulas This paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations An upper bound p=k is derived for the order of accuracy of Ainf-stable formulas Three criteria are given for A0-stability It is shown that 1 for p=k k arbitrary Ainf-stability implies certain necessary conditions for A0-stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of ppsi satisfy |psi|<1 2 for p=k=234and 5 Ainf-stability for k=5 together with another constraint implies strict stability and 3 for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with p=k=34andor 5 Ainf-stability implies A0-stability CACM January 1975 Liniger W stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy A0-stability Ainf-stability strict stability 5.17 CA750111 JB January 12 1978 9:26 AM 2800 5 2800 2800 5 2800 2800 5 2800
