An  <strong style='color:blue;''>operating system</strong>  which is organized as a
small supervisor and a set of independent processes 
are described.  The supervisor handles I/O with external
devices-the file and directory system-schedules 
active processes and manages memory, handle errors, and
provides a small set of primitive functions which 
it will execute for a process.  A process is able to
specify a request for a complicated action on the 
part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence
of a compound event in the system) by combining 
these primitives into a "supervisory computer program."
 The part of the supervisor which executes these 
programs may be viewed as a software implemented "supervisory
computer."  The paper develops these concepts 
in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor, and
discusses some of the advantages of this approach.

Time- <strong style='color:blue;''>sharing system</strong> s, as defined in this article,
are those multiaccess systems which permit 
a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources
of the system while sharing its time with other 
terminal users.  It is each terminal user's ability
to utilize the full resources of the system that 
makes quantitative evaluation of time-sharing systems
particularly difficult.  Six criteria are described 
which have been successfully used to perform first-level
quantitative time-sharing system performance 
evaluation.

considered.  Details of a specific word recognition program are given.  This 
technique depends on three simplifying restrictions, namely, a "small"
vocabulary set, "known" speakers, and a "moment of silence"
between each input word.  Experimental results are presented giving
error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine 
resources required to accommodate several users at a time. The results show 
that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at 
least 40 users at a time with an IBM 360/65 computer.

 The Date Collection Facility (DCF) has been implemented
in the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) for the 
System/360 model 67.  It exists for the purpose of monitoring
operating system and user program behavior 
and performance.  The overall structure of MTS is outlined
in order to explain the implementation of 
the DCF.  Events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 Events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 The time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  The overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  Several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  Some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.

number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  Each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  Priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  A scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  Overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  The algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has provided significantly better service to interactive
and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.

 This freedom simplified both incremental compilation

communication mechanisms enabling the construction 
of hierarchical subsystems.  It also suggested an important
new concept for operating systems: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource
allocation. This separation enables incorporation 
of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without
endangering the system integration (correctly

A simulation model of a time- <strong style='color:blue;''>sharing system</strong> 
with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  The effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

is described.  The model transferred control to the
operating system to execute functions other than

teaching.  The teaching system (ABAC-II) was 
written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for
the IBM 7044 Graphic System.  Because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode.  During the latter, the 
full resources of the operating system (language processors,
compilers, library and user's programs) 
were at his disposal.  He could for example, write, assemble,
debug, and execute at the terminal a program 
written in any language processed by the operating system.
 A course could therefore include text material 
interleaved with programming problems which the student
could solve without leaving the terminal.  Exercises 
in simulation and gaming could also be provided.  The
implications of a teaching system with this degree 
of flexibility for industrial and executive training
as well as academic education are discussed.  In 
addition, the advantages of this type of system for computer
programming and operation are also considered.

   ALGEM - An Algebra <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> c Manipulator

   ALGEM is a package of subprograms written in Slip, FORTRAN IV and MAP 7094 
II to manipulate algebraic expressions. Algem's basic algebraic operations are 
additions, subtractions, multiplications, division and exponentiation. It is 
capable of handling any number of single letter variables, variable exponents, 
and of finding the highest common factor of two polynomials. Also included are
such functions as substitution, differentiation, determining coefficients of
specified variables, solving a linear equation, basic I/O routines plus other
special purpose and arithmetic routines. The major innovation of Algem over 
other manipulators is the assignment of types to all expressions and the use 
of a standard ordering procedure.

Arguments for a Morator <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> um on the Construction
of a Community Information Utility

In this article the author urges a prudent
and decentralized approach to the question of the 
design and desirability of computerized community information
utilities.  Before accepting the inevitability 
and desirability of this or any technology, we should:
(1) be sure of the feasibility (internally and 
externally) of what is proposed; (2) project and perhaps
wait for changes in complementary techniques; 
(3) evaluate current and projected supplementary techniques;
(4) establish the existence of demand for 
what is proposed; (5) take steps to involve a representative
group of ultimate users in systems design, 
and (6) carefully think through possible side effects
on man and his world view.  Current proposals for 
community information utilities are examined in this
framework, and the conclusion is drawn that society 
is not yet in a position to justify either the construction
of an information utility in a prototype 
community or the acceptance of a policy in
favor of its widespread implementation.

Over the past decade there has been a significant growth
in the use of computer technology by U. police departments.  This
growth, however, has been at a slower rate than predicted in the
early 1970's.  Further, when computer applications extend
beyond "routine" uses to "nonroutine" efforts, such as resource allocation
or computer-aided-dispatch systems where the machine begins to become
a tool for decision making, strategic planning and person/machine
interaction, the results of the technology to date have been
mixed.  This paper reports on case studies and surveys which provinsights 
on the implementation and impact of police computer technology
and the relationship of this technology to law enforcement and society.

A Card Format for Reference F <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> les in Information Processing

This paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  An 80-column IBM card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  The reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
The identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  The 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

the corresponding line segments, that give the 
best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval.
 Bellman confined himself primarily to the 
analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however,
how the solution of the equation derived for each 
particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to
a discrete search.  In this paper, the computational 
procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities
to some of Stone's equations are indicated. 
 It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving
no minimization may be found.  In addition, 
it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the
curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints 
are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve.

Formal Pars <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng Systems

Automatic syntactic analysis has recently become
important for both natural language data processing 
and syntax-directed compilers.  A formal parsing system
G = (V,u,T,R) consists of two finite disjoint 
vocabularies, V and T, a many-many map, u, from V onto
T, and a recursive set R of strings in T called 
syntactic sentence classes.  Every program for automatic
syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing 
system.  A directed production analyzer (I,T,X,p) is a
nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal 
vocabulary I, input vocabulary T, and all productions
of p in the form:  (Z,a) -> aY1 ... Ym where  Z, 
Yi are elements of the set I and a is an element of the
set T.  Every context-free language can be analyzed 
by a directed production analyzer.  The Kuno-Oettinger
multiple-path syntactic analyzer for English is 
a concrete example of a directed production analyzer
and of a working parsing algorithm.  The connection 
between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of
a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined 
in this paper.

BLNSYS-A 1401 Operat <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng System with Braille Capabilities

BLNSYS is an operating system designed for
a 4K 1401 with common optional features and two 
attached tape drives.  Printed output of this system
or of executing programs may be in either English 
or braille.  Even though this system was written for
a small machine with minimal peripheral equipment, 
jobs may be batched, so that card handling and lost
processing time is at a minimum.  This system will 
perform any or all of the following users specified
functions: assemble SPS source decks, post list, 
produce condensed or uncondensed object decks, execute
user's program, list card input to a program, 
list punched output, provide a storage dump, execute
a program submitted for execution as an uncondensed 
object deck under debugging trace control, card-to-braille
conversion, brailled listings of 7040 IBSYS 
batch output, and update or duplicate the system tape
itself.  Input-ouput subroutines are also included 
in the system.

An Algor <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> thm for the Blocks and Cutnodes of a Graph

An efficient method is presented for finding
blocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected 
graph.  The graph may be represented either (i) as an
ordered list of edges or (ii) as a packed adjacency 
matrix.  If w denotes the word length of the machine
employed, the storage (in machine words) required 
for a graph with n nodes and m edges increases essentially
as 2(m+n) in case (i), or (n^2)/win case 
(ii).  A spanning tree with labeled edges is grown,
two edges finally bearing different labels if and 
only if they belong to different blocks.  For both representations
the time required to analyze a graph 
on n nodes increases as n^G where G depends on the type
of graph, 1 <= G <= 2, and both bounds are attained. 
 Values of G are derived for each of several suitable
families of test graphs, generated by an extension 
of the web grammar approach.  The algorithm is compared
in detail with that proposed by Read for which 
1 <= G <= 3.

Des <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> gn and Implementation of a Diagnostic Compiler for PL/I

PL/C is a compiler for a dialect for PL/I.  The
design objective was to provide a maximum degree 
of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment.
 For the most part this assistance is implicit 
and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable
characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance-it 
completes translation of every program submitted and
continues execution until a user-established error 
limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair
errors encountered during both translation 
and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by
this consideration.  PL/C also introduces several 
explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing.
 To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without 
abandoning compatibility with IBM compiler PL/C permits
"pseudo comments"-constructions whose contents 
can optionally be considered either source test or comment.
 In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is 
a fast and efficient processor.  It effectively demonstrates
that compilers can provide better diagnostic 
assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated
source language is employed, and that 
this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.

SP/k: A System for Teach <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng Computer Programming

SP/k is a compatible subset of the PL/I  language
that has been designed for teaching programming. 
The features of the SP/k language were chosen to encourage
structured problem solving by computers, to 
make the language easy to learn and use, to eliminate
confusing and redundant constructs, and to make 
the language easy to compile.  The resulting language
is suitable for in troducing programming concepts 
used in various applications, including business data
processing, scientific calculations and non-numeric 
computation.  SP/k is actually a sequence of language
subsets called SP/1, SP/2,..P/8.  Each subset 
in troduces new programming language constructs while
retaining all the constructs of preceding subsets. 
Each subset is precisely defined and can be learned
or implemented without the following subsets.

The Ed <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ting  of Picture Segmentations Using Local Analysis of Graphs

A major problem in picture processing is the
elimination of the large number of spurious regions 
that result from an initial segmentation by region growing
techniques.  Such regions have been eliminated 
either on the basis of semantic information or on the
basis of size and contrast.  A scheme is presented 
which performs eliminations on the basis of local properties
of the region adjacency graph.  The scheme 
is based on definitions of graph properties which are
satisfied when a spurious region is present; then 
editing is equivalent to fast graph operations.  A number of examples are shown.

The concepts of list processing have been introduced

 Most list-processing languages have suffered from their
inability to deal directly with complex data

upon the data list structures.  These two problems have

Analys <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> s of the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra

Analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  These results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  A major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to Markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  Since many physical
systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.

Consider a magnetic tape system with a read
check after writing.  Where an error occurs in 
writing a record, a programmed error routine may either
bypass some or all of the area on tape or try 
to rewrite the record on the same area.  This paper evaluates
these two procedures on the basis of expected 
loss of computer time and develops a decision rule for
selecting the optimum procedure.  The rule depends 
critically on the number of times the tape being written
will be used in the future.  In the case where 
the optimum procedure is to bypass an area, a second
decision-the size of the area to be bypassed-is 
necessary.  A formula is developed to determine the
optimum area to be bypassed for each procedure.

A System for Typesett <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng Mathematics

This paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 The language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  Experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  For typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  For example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  The syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  Output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  The system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

Abstract <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> on Mechanisms in CLU

CLU is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 Work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  Of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  This paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU.  By 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  The 
CLU library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile 
time, is also discussed.

users while at the same time running several 
off line (background) jobs.  The system is not oriented
towards either mode and can be either a batch

or GECOS), or a multiaccess system (resembling, 
to the user, CTSS or MULTICS), or both simultaneously,
depending on the installation, which can adjust 
the Schedulers.  Both online users and off line jobs use
a common Command Language.  The system includes

Interval Ar <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> thmetic Determinant Evaluation
and Its Use in Testing for a Chebyshev System

Two recent papers, one by Hansen and one by
Hansen and R. R. Smith, have shown how Interval 
Arithmetic (I.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  In the present paper 
a method proposed by Hasen and R. R. Smith is compared
with straightforward use of I. in determinant 
evaluation.  Computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
I. for determinant evaluation.  An application using
I. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a Chebyshev system is then presented.

NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement

Symbol <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> c Execution and Program Testing

This paper describes the symbolic execution of
programs.  Instead of supplying the normal inputs 
to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing
arbitrary values.  The execution proceeds 
as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic
formulas over the input symbols.  The difficult, 
yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution
of conditional branch type statements.  A 
particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic
execution for program testing and debugging is 
also described.  It interpretively executes programs written
in a simple PL/I style programming language. 
 It includes many standard debugging features, the ability
to manage and to prove things about symbolic 
expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program
verifier.  A brief discussion of the relationship 
between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.

Incorporat <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng Origin Shifts into the QR
Algorithm for Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrices

The QR iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can 
be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts.  The origin shift
may be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements of
the matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm.  Both
methods have drawbacks: the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small 
eigenvalues, while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and 
thereby retard the convergence.  This paper presents a new method which has 
neither drawback.

An interactive program
with a graphical display has been developed for the approximation of
data by means of a linear combination of functions (including
splines) selected by the user.  The coefficients of the approximation
are determined by linear programming so as to minimize the error
in either the L1 or L-infinity norm.  Auxiliary conditions such as
monotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed. This

Mechan <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> zation of the Curve Fitting Process: DATAN

A process for fitting a curve to approximate data
and the problem it creates for the engineer-programmer 
is defined.  An approach has also been defined and a system
has been written for the SRU 1107 to mechanize 
a major portion of this process.  The techniques developed
to accomplish the mechanization are largely 
empirical, and are dependent for their information
only on the actual data points.

A Western V <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ew of Computer History

Many U. histories of the digital computer
field have tended to be impersonal, with heavy 
emphasis on eastern universities and commercial developments.
 This article records the events of the 
early years in a personal way.  The people, organizations,
technologies, and computers of the 1945-55 
period in the western part of the United Statesare described as they happened.

Expand <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng the Editing Function In Language Data Processing

In automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  This paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "Heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  Other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  Applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  Applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone.

use for the definition of programming  <strong style='color:blue;''>languages</strong>  
and compilers; a formal definition of attribute grammars
and a discussion of some of its important aspects 
are included. The paper concentrates on the evaluation
of semantic attributes in a few passes from left 
to right over the derivation tree of a program.  A
condition for an attribute grammar is given which 
assures that the semantics of any program can be evaluated
in a single pass over the derivation tree, 
and an algorithm is discussed which decides how many
passes from left to right are in general necessary, 
given the attribute grammar. These notions are explained
in terms of an example grammar which describes 
the scope rules of Algol 60.  Practical questions, such
as the relative efficiency of different evaluation 
schemes, and the ease of adapting the attribute grammar
of a given programming language to the left-to-right 
evaluation scheme are discussed.

 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural

statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations

by an existing NELIAC compiler.  This experience has
shown there is no inherent difficulty in "building 
compilers with compilers"; indeed, it pointed out many advantages
in using a POL for constructing programming 
systems.  This report presents the results of a project
completed in May, 1961 in which the NELIAC system 
was used to generate a compiler for the IBM 1401.  The
1401 compiler, which runs on the 7090 and produces 
1401 programs, was described in the NELIAC language and
generated with 7090 NELIAC system.  The reduction 
in programming time and the improvement in documentation
of the system were very significant.

almost universally associated with context-free requirements.
 Yet numerous interesting and difficult 
issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive requirements,
notably the compatibility between the

issues arising from block structure.  This paper explores
the use of a formal notation called Production

 In this paper, it is contended that a programming

of macro instructions, and that the macro call constitutes
a canonical form in terms of which a programming 
notation may be described.  A supporting discussion of the
logical and his torical role of the macro instruction 
is presented.  Also discussed are the conflict between
machine independence and object program efficiency, 
and the question of where the greatest difficulties
lie in compiler construction.

SD(Gs,X) assigned to a given sentence X by the predictive

the structural descriptions SD(G,X) assigned to the

originally due to Abbott is described standard-form

derivation from the original context-free grammar. 
A technique for performing the SD(Gs,X) to SD(G,X) 
transformation effectively is also described.  In section
2, the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing 
algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared
with two other parsing algorithms: a selective 
top-to-bottom algorithm similar to Irons' "error correcting
parse algorithm" and an immediate constituent 
analyzer which is an extension of Sakai-Cocke's algorithm
for normal grammars.  The comparison is based 
upon several criteria of efficiency, covering core-storage
requirements, complexities of the programs 
and processing time.

Multi-Tape and Inf <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> ite-State Automata -- A Survey

A survey of machines which are more powerful
than finite automata and less powerful than general 
Turing machines is presented.  It is felt that the machines
in this category are as closely related to 
digital computers as either the finite automata or the
unrestricted Turing machines.  Intermediate machines 
can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memory
to a finite-state machine and then performing any 
or all of the following: (1) restrict the manner in
which the unbounded portion of the memory can be 
accessed, (2) bound the number of steps allowed for a
computation by some increasing recursive function 
of the length of the input, (3) restrict the total amount
of memory available in the same manner.  Examples 
from all three classes and their properties are discussed.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-3105.html</h3><br/><p>	This
paper shows how to extend programming  <strong style='color:blue;''>languages</strong>  
to provide controlled sharing.  The extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

technique using a single stack to hold 
procedure activation storage which allows retention
of that storage for durations not necessarily tied

in the simple case,it runs identically to the 
usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure.
 Applications of this technique to multitasking, 
coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and

model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation
assumes multiple-processes coordinate 
by passing control explicitly to one another.  A multiprocessor
implementation requires only a few changes 
to the basic technique, as described.

The nature of the difficulty involved in communicating
mathematical results between scientists 
using a computer based information retrieval system
is examined.  The problem is analyzed in terms of 
psychological and information-processing processes, and
what turns out to be a vicious circle of effects 
is described.  These include ways of augmenting written
natural language by various notational and linguistic 
devices, the exhibition of the structure inherent in the
information we are communicating, and a sophisticated

For the segmentation of a program it is useful
to have a reasonable estimation of the values 
of S(ij), where S(ij) is the mean value of the number
of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th 
instruction in the run time.  In the cases where the
S(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the 
whole program must be generally taken into account;
therefore it is very difficult for the programmer 
and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of
the S(ij).  It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but 
the quantities P(ij)=S(ij)*C(i)/SUM[S(ij), j=1,N], where
C(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each 
i.  Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to
S(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because 
we must estimate only the "probabilities" of events
where instruction i is executed after instruction 
I(i).  This estimation can often be done without considering
the structure of the whole program.  In 
the first part of the paper, using the theory of the
Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation 
of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways
of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given.  In 
the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived,
avoiding the necessity of computation involving 
large matrices.

are presented for building, in a mechanical 
way, perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transforming
the elements of I into unique addresses. 
 The first method, the "quotient reduction" method, is
shown to be complete in the sense that for every 
set I the smallest table in which the elements of I
can be stored and from which they can be retrieved 
by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this
method can be found.  However, for nonuniformly

to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for 
every kind of set.  The two techniques are applicable
directly to small sets.  Some methods to extend 
these results to larger sets are also presented.  A rough
comparison with ordinary hashing is given which 
shows that this method can be used conveniently
in several practical applications.

statements together, (3) the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs.  Several alternative
forms of each of these components are described, 
compared and evaluated.  Many examples, frequently from
list processing languages, illustrate the forms 
described.  Elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands, requirements, or implicit 
specifications.  A command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken.  A requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken.  An implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  An execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  Names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language.   He concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs, organizing systems, and referencing 
data.

Simulation models of large, complex "real-world"
applications have occasionally earned the 
reputation of eating up hours of computer time.  This
problem may be attributed in part to difficulties 
such as slow stochastic convergence.  However, an additional
problem lies in the fact that a significant 
amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events
in their proper sequence.  This paper presents 
a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning
future event lists in discrete event simulations. 
 There models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness
as the events-list scan problem becomes 
more burdensome.

Opt <strong style='color:blue;''>im</strong> al His togram Matching by Monotone Gray Level Transformation

This paper investigates the problem of optimal
his togram matching using monotone gray level 
transformation, which always assigns all picture points
of a given gray level i to another gray level 
T(i) such that if i > j, then T(i) > T(j).  The objective
is to find a transformed digital picture of 
a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors
between the gray level his togram of the transformed 
picture and that of a reference picture is minimized.
 This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered 
objects of different sized one by one into k2 linearly ordered
boxes of assorted sizes, such that the 
accumulated error of space under packed or overpacked
in the boxes is minimized; the placement function 
is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution

items or of words allowable  <strong style='color:blue;''>in a</strong>  language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

Comparison of Their Values  <strong style='color:blue;''>in a</strong>  Problem - 
Solving Situation

An experimental comparison of problem-solving
using time-sharing and batch-processing computer 
systems conducted at MIT is described in this paper.
 This study is the first known attempt to evaluate 
two such systems for what may well be the predominant user
population within the next decade-the professionals 
who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an
aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather 
than as a programming end in itself.  Statistically
and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  There are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  The users' speed of problem-solving and their
attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable 
system.

 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

with the aid of an unsanitized version of the 
Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative,
and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago 
for whatever reasons.  Modern computer technology could
obviously perform signature analyses the process 
of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
insights into their construction.  For the benefit 
of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the
second cypher employs a specified document whose 
words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters
of these words are sought out at random to 
match the letters of these words are sought out at random
to match the letters of the clear text or message. 
 The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
is then written down as the final code.  While 
primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
security until the source document becomes known; 
at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
graders.  The work now completed with the help 
of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies
of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. 
 For example, we have turned the entire process of
simulated encoding by various schemes over to the 
machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic
codes; we have also encoded various messages by 
hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to
obtain their signatures. These simulations provide 
convincing evidence that the signatures are both process
and data dependent; they indicate also very 
strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that
it is merely a matter of time before someone 
finds the correct source document and locates the
right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.

and some relevant theories of music and harmony are given.
 Problems with this kind of program and several 
schemes that are known not to work are discussed.  Several
previous computer compositions are discussed, 
including the ILLIAC Suite.  A program to generate short
melody fragments was written to simulate some 
of the aspects of human composition.  Five samples of
its output are presented and discussed.  It was 
discovered that although the fragments show many of
the characteristics of popular melodies, they have 
a strangely alien sound.  It is theorized that this
is because the relevant probabilities which would 
discriminate against unfamiliar sequences were not used.

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>id</strong> ea of constructing a computer design
language by making use of an ALGOL-like programming 
language is presented.  A computer designer can benefit
from using a design language at a higher level 
just as a computer user can benefit from a higher level
programming language.  The purposes and requirements 
of the design language are enumerated.  To achieve most
of the purposes a translator is required to translate 
a design of computer logic into a set of Boolean equations.
 The design language is presented in terms 
of vocabulary, statements, sequences and microprogram.
 Included are examples of identifiers, expressions 
with both unary and binary operators, declaration statements,
transfer statements, terminal statements,

The prime functi <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  of a drum, operating in
real time, is to perform accesses quickly.  The 
usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate
engineering or hardware improvements.  In 
this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the
drum, but rather by modifying the manner in which 
it operates.  At the outset, a drum is given a functional
definition.  Then a simple design scheme (Eschenbach) 
is introduced which enormously increases the rate of
accessing for drums so defined.  This is shown to 
enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or
less expensive drums.  It is suggested that although 
the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it
has more general applicability.  The question 
of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised.  To
deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed 
in light of realistic real-time circumstances.  The drum
scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits 
it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. 
Thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum 
scheme is efficient enough for its application.  Again,
whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a 
specific use, the methods underlying it have more general applicability.

The Design and Implementati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  of a Table Driven,
Interactive Diagnostic Programming System

CAPS is a highly interactive diagnostic compiler/interpreter
that allows beginning programmers 
to prepare, debug, and execute fairly simple programs
at a graphics display terminal.  Complete syntax 
checking and most semantic analysis is performed as
the program is entered and as it is subsequently
edited.  Analysis is performed character by character.
 The most remarkable feature of CAPS is its ability 
to automatically diagnose errors both at compile time
and at run time.  Errors are not automatically 
corrected.  Instead, CAPS interacts with the student to help
him find the cause of his error.  Most components 
of CAPS are table driven, both to reduce the space needed
for implementation and to increase the flexibility 
of the multilingual system.  Over 500 students have used
CAPS to learn Fortran, PL/I, or Cobolin conjunction 
with a computer assisted course on introductory computer science.

It is quite difficult to characterize a particular

 Based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 No claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  Using the model we answer questions like: 
How many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  What bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  Answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system

A Phonological Rule Tester

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>design and implementation</strong>  of a system to
alleviate the problem of rule evaluation for the 
linguist in the area of phonology are presented.  It
permits the user to define, on-line, sets of rules 
statable within the framework presented in The Sound
Patterns of English by Chomsky and Halle, 1968, 
to define phonemes as bundles of specified distinctive
features, to define data as strings of phonemes 
with associated grammatical structure, to test the effect
of applying rules to the data, and to store 
both the definitions and results.  The rule application
facility described in detail was implemented 
by translating linguistic rules to rules in FLIP, a
format-directed list processor embedded in LISP. 
 This made the system construction easy while providing
sophisticated capabilities for the linguist. 
 The system is written in BBN LISP on the Scientific
Data System 940 computer and is designed to be used 
on-line in interactive fashion, with control returned
to the user after each command is executed.

Automati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  of Etching-Pattern Layout

HELP (Heuristic Etching-Pattern Layout Program)
is an application program developed to computerize 
the tedious and error-prone although vitally important
wiring design of printed circuit boards.  HELP 
helps automate a design stage one step closer to production
than logical design.  It can be used to design 
wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on which
ICs in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete 
components such as transistors and resistors have been
placed.  HELP employs two methods of wiring.  
One is the heuristic method, which simulates human
approaches to wiring design, and the other is the 
theoretically interesting but time-consuming method of
maze-running, based on the Lee's algorithm.  HELP 
performs more than 90 percent of required wiring by
the heuristic path with respect to a performance 
function for each point-to-point, and point-to-line
connection.  It can bring the number of successful 
wiring connections very close to 100 percent.

Systems Design Educati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> : A Gaming Approach

One of the problems facing managers of computer
installations is the problem of configuring 
the computer system to meet the demands made by the
mix of jobs that the computer center must service. 
 This paper presents a management game that allows
the player to configure a computer system to meet 
a hypothetical job mix is under the control of a game administrator
and can be varied to simulate a variety 
of real-world situations (I/O bound jobs, compute bound
jobs, etc.).  The player of the game receives 
a set of detailed reports on the cost of his choices
and a simulated run of the center operating under 
his choices.

a thorough understanding of the related computer technology.  Concepts
such as paging and priority interrupt systems can best be explained at the

spurious issues as possible; (2) allow, without undue effort, the

(7) allow the student ready access to the machine; (8) be capable

constructed a simulated machine and its associated software which

This paper prov <strong style='color:blue;''>id</strong> es data on Cobol error frequency
for correction of errors in student-oriented 
compilers, improvement of teaching, and changes in programming
language.  Cobol was studied because of 
economic importance, widespread usage, possible error-including
design, and lack of research.  The types 
of errors were identified in a pilot study; then, using
the 132 error types found, 1,777 errors were 
classified in 1,4000 runs of 73 Cobol students.  Error
density was high: 20 percent of the types contained 
80 percent of the total frequency, which implies high
potential effectiveness for software based correction 
of Cobol.  Surprisingly, only four high-frequency errors
were error-prone, which implies minimal error 
inducing design. 80 percent of Cobol misspellings were classifiable
in the four error categories of previous 
researchers, which implies that Cobol misspellings
are correctable by existent algorithms.  Reserved 
word usage was not error-prone, which implies minimal
interference with usage of reserved words.  Over 
80 percent of error diagnosis was found to be inaccurate.
 Such feedback is not optimal for users, particularly 
for the learning user of Cobol.

This paper describes the  <strong style='color:blue;''>design and implementation</strong> 
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 The language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  Experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  For typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  For example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  The syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  Output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  The system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

Design:  An Application to Circuit Project

The characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process, are presented.  The main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  The first one is IMOL, an interactive monitor language,
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design.  The second one is 
COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed
to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; 
it is an  extension of Fortran with graphic-type variables,
so that the designer who is familiar with Fortran need not learn a new 
language.  The application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications.

are the heart of COKO's effectiveness, yet they are
conceptually simple.  In addition, an interesting 
phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued
COKO's entire development just as it troubles 
a human player.  Standard exponential growth is curbed
to a large extent by the definition and trimming 
of the Fischer set.  A clear distinction between tree
pruning and selective tree searching is also made. 
 Representation of the chess environment is described
along with a strategical preanalysis procedure 
that maps the Lasker regions.  Specific chess algorithms
are described which could be used as a command 
structure by anyone desiring to do some chess program
experimentation.  A comparison is made of some 
mysterious actions of human players and COKO III.

A significant increase  <strong style='color:blue;''>in the</strong>  capability for
controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation 
is achieved through skeleton control.  This technique
allows an animator to develop a complex motion 
sequence by animating a stick figure representation
of an image.  This control sequence is then used 
to drive an image sequence through the same movement.
 The simplicity of the stick figure image encourages 
a high level of interaction during the design stage. 
Its compatibility with the basic key frame animation 
technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively
to only those components of a composite 
image sequence that require enhancement.

Record linkage  <strong style='color:blue;''>in the</strong>  updating of files is
accomplished in many establishments through the 
use of a preassigned number, such as payroll number,
customer number, or social security number.  In 
vital and health records, however, a unique number
is generally not preassigned to an individual for 
purposes of reporting services received to the health
department.  In order to determine whether different 
physician reports refer to the same individual, name
and other identification must be compared.  This 
is a laborious operation which is subject to various
errors because of name misspellings, changes of 
name upon marriage, and other problems.  We are interested
in the maintenance of a psychiatric case register 
in Maryland, where many of the reports from over a hundred
psychiatric agencies refer to the same patient. 
 These records must be linked in order to provide unduplicated
counts of individuals under care and longitudinal 
records of psychiatric history.  An earlier paper [1] describes
our general procedures for register maintenance 
by use of a digital computer (Honeywell 800).  Here
we present in more detail our initial procedures 
for the person-matching process in order to elicit comments

A Card Format for Reference Files  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Information Processing

This paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  An 80-column IBM card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  The reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
The identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  The 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

The ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
It is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 Based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 No claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  Using the model we answer questions like: 
How many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  What bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  Answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

An Algorithm for Deriv <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g the Equations of
Mathematical Physics by Symbolic Manipulation

A method is described whereby a digital computer
can be used to derive the equations of mathematical 
physics in any curvilinear coordinate system requested
by the user.  The effectiveness of the technique 
is demonstrated by using it to derive the Navier-Stokes
equations of fluid motion and the continuity 
equation.  To derive these equations by this method, the
user need know only the coordinate transformation 
equations relating the curvilinear coordinates of interest
to an orthogonal Cartesian triad. When this 
program is used and the coordinate transformation equations
are supplied as input, the computer will 
derive the Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity
equation.  The equations obtained will be relative 
to the curvilinear coordinate system specified by the
transformation equations used as input.  In this 
paper the emphasis is on theoretical considerations and
methodology rather than on programming details. 
 Results are presented for cylindrical polar
and spherical polar coordinate systems.

Based on information from translations of Communist
Chinese news items and periodical literature 
for the 1965 period, computer technology in China is
reviewed under the following headings: (1) initial 
planning, organization and educational aspects of computer
technology and automation; (2) machine development 
progress: two major specific machines in 1958-59, with
Soviet aid; a vacuum in 1960-64 due to the withdrawal 
of Soviet aid; then presumably all-Chinese-made machines
from 1965 to the present; (3) computer applications; 
(4) the trend of automation: control of production processes
rather than data processing; and (5) the 
"Yun Ch'ou Hsueh" (Science of Operation and Programming)
campaign of 1958-60, during which an attempt 
was made to bring concepts such as linear programming
to ordinary Chinese workers and peasants.  Communist 
China is adjudged to have a marginal computer capability,
with most of its machines probably being of 
a binary nature; however, a turning point may have been reached in mid-1965.

The findings of a study designed to address

are presented here.  A planning methodology was 
developed and tested through implementation at a university.
 Two years after the methodology was implemented, 
the effectiveness of the planning methodology was assessed
in terms of the improvement of the delivery 
of computing services to the major institutional roles
of instruction, research, and administration. 
 Two control institutions were employed to contrast the
improvements at the test institution.  The results 
of the research indicate the planning methodology significantly
enhanced the delivery of computing services.

In this paper CADEP, a problem-oriented language
for positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional 
space, is presented.  Although the language has been
specifically designed for the automatic generation 
of integrated circuit masks, it turns out to be well
suited also for such other placement problems as 
architecture design, urban planning, logical and block
diagram representation.  The design criteria, 
the structure, and the specific features of CADEP are illustrated.

The introduction of computers in to the banking
business has a wide variety of legal implications 
that merit careful attention at this very early stage.
 The industry is highly regulated by government 
and, hence, is subject to many statutes and regulations.
 It also is affected by important common law 
rules established by courts.  The legal ramifications
involve not only the mechanization itself, but 
also the very significant, economically attractive phenomenon
of off premises processing.  It is essential 
to identify and provide for many legal aspects right
now, before systems and practices crystallize, in 
order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical
complications and expense.  The legal aspects 
of computerization in the banking business are especially
diverse.  In some states, there might be the 
basic question whether banks are authorized by law to
invest in the new facilities, either directly or 
through cooperatives.  More challenging are questions
relating to off-premises processors, particularly 
with respect to the obligation not to disclose information
concerning a bank's customers, the adequacy 
of fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for
improper refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility 
to regulation by government agencies.  Also pertinent
is the propriety of data processing by banks for 
nonbank entities and particularly of the rendering of
that service without charge for bank depositors.

technique uses a good heuristic to direct 
the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search
space, since the number of solutions increases 
with the number of test variables according to a double 
exponential.  In this paper we suggest a heuristically 
guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic
programming, recognizes identical subproblems but 
which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal
solutions.  The heuristic search method introduced 
in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above
two techniques.  Compressed tables with a large 
number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first.

Levels of Computer Systems

In build <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g current computer systems, we tend
to break them down into "levels" of control, 
command and communication; in using the system, we break
our problems down correspondingly.  The continued 
use of such a structure raises questions about its effects
on the usefulness of future systems, particularly 
with regard to such trends as time sharing, parallel
programming, and, eventually, systems which learn. 
 In this essay some of these questions are posed, and

A Heuristic Problem Solv <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Design System
for Equipment or Furniture Layouts

The Designer Problem Solver (DPS) demonstrates
that the computer can perform simple design 
tasks.  In particular, it designs furniture and equipment
layouts.  This task was chosen because it is 
simple, well defined, and characteristic of many design
tasks in architecture, engineering, urban planning, 
and natural resource management.  These space planning
tasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional 
representations of objects to create feasible or optimal
solutions for problems involving topological 
and metric spatial constraints.  The paper describes
extensive tests performed on the program.  DPS is 
a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixed
to it.  It uses the planning process to give 
it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures to locate
difficulties, and remedial actions to recover 
from difficulties.  It uses a convex polygon representation
to accurately describe the objects and the 
layout.  This representation allows topological and
metric constraints to be tested and the design to 
be easily updated.  DPS has been applied to 50 problems.
 While it is slow and limited in scope, the 
ideas behind it are general.  It demonstrates the need
for selectivity in controlling search and the 
methods used to achieve it: task-specific information,
planning, diagnostic procedures, remedial actions, 
and selective alternative generators.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>in the</strong>  efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

From the inequality 10^8 < 2^27,  <strong style='color:blue;''>we are</strong>  likely
to conclude that we can represent 8-digit decimal 
floating-point numbers accurately by 27-bit floating-point
numbers.  However, we need 28 significant 
bits to represent some 8-digit numbers accurately. 
In general, we can show that if 10^p < 2^q-1, then 
q significant bits are always enough for p-digit decimal
accuracy.  Finally, we can define a compact 
27-bit floating-point representation that will give 28
significant bits, for numbers of practical importance.

P <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ctorial Pattern Recognition and the
Phase Problem of X-ray Crystallography

The availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

Sentence Paraphras <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng from a Conceptual Base

A model of natural language based on an underlying
language-free representation of meaning 
is described.  A program based on this model is able
to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate 
understanding with respect to a given context.  This
generator operates in conjunction with a natural 
language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model.
 In generating sentences from meaning structures, 
the program employs both the information retrieval and
deduction capabilities of the memory model.  The 
model encompasses several diverse classes of linguistic
knowledge, which include: (1) executable tests 
of conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets;
(2) information relating conceptual to syntactic 
roles, stored in a word-sense dictionary, and (3) surface
grammatical knowledge, stored in a formal grammar.

A Stat <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> stical Model for Console Behavior in Multiuser Computers

The ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
It is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 Based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 No claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  Using the model we answer questions like: 
How many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  What bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  Answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

Mult <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ple Terminals Under User Program
Control in a Time-Sharing Environment

User-written programs on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing
system can communicate with many remote 
terminals simultaneously and can control the interactions
between these terminals.  Such programs can 
be written using standard input and output instructions
in any language available on the system.  This 
paper describes how this multiple-terminal facility
was implemented without requiring any changes in 
the system executive or in any of the system's compilers or interpreters.

Mult <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> programming STRETCH: Feasibility Considerations

The tendency towards increased parallelism in
computers is noted.  Exploitation of this parallelism 
presents a number of new problems in machine design
and in programming systems.  Minimum requirements 
for successful concurrent execution of several independent
problem programs are discussed.  These requirements 
are met in the STRETCH system by a carefully balanced
combination of built-in and programmed logic.  
Techniques are described which place the burden of the
programmed logic on system programs (supervisory 
program and compiler) rather than on problem programs.

Main tenance Protocol for a Distributed Computer 
Network

In order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot
Potato Heuristic Routing Doctrine."  A correctness 
proof of this Topology Information Protocol is also presented.

could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

The Use of Normal Mult <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> plication Tables
for Information Storage and Retrieval

This paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based information systems, using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system.  Algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval of information are described.  This method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  Several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  Algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  For a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
Moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique.

method can be found.  However, for nonuniformly 
distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables.
 The second method, the "remainder reduction" 
method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems
to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for 
every kind of set.  The two techniques are applicable
directly to small sets.  Some methods to extend 
these results to larger sets are also presented.  A rough
comparison with ordinary hashing is given which 
shows that this method can be used conveniently

Synchron <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> zation of Communicating Processes

Formalization of a well-defined synchronization
mechanism can be used to prove that concurrently 
running processes of a system communicate correctly.
 This is demonstrated for a system consisting of 
many sending processes which deposit messages in a buffer
and many receiving processes which remove messages 
from that buffer.  The formal description of the synchronization
mechanism makes it very easy to prove 
that the buffer will neither overflow nor underflow,
that senders and receivers will never operate on 
the same message frame in the buffer nor will they run into a deadlock.

Spell <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng Correction in Systems Programs

Several specialized techniques are shown for efficiently
incorporating spelling correction algorithms in
to compilers and operating systems.  These include the use of syntax
and semantics information, the organization of restricted keyword
and symbol tables, and the consideration of a limited class of spelling
errors.  Sample 360 coding for performing spelling correction
is presented.  By using systems which perform spelling correction,
the number of debugging runs per program has been decreased,
saving both programmer and machine time.

GIT-A Heur <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> stic Program for Testing Pairs
of Directed Line Graphs for Isomorphism*

Given a pair of directed line graphs, the problem
of ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic 
is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known.
 Since a straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years of running time on a very high
speed computer in order to compare two 15-node 
graphs, a more sophisticated approach seems called
for.  The situation is similar to that prevailing 
in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving, where
practical algorithms are unknown (for the interesting 
cases), but where various practical though only partially
successful techniques are available.  Git-Graph 
Isomorphism Tester-incorporates a variety of processes
that attempt to narrow down the search for an 
isomorphism, or to demonstrate that none exists.  No one
scheme is relied upon exclusively for a solution, 
and the program is designed to avoid excessive computation
along fruitless lines.  GIT has been written 
in the COMIT language and successfully tested on the IBM 7090.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1381.html</h3><br/><p>	of Computers on the Undergraduate Mathemat <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> cs Curriculum 

The use of computers to permit the widespread application
of mathematical ideas requiring computation 
in science and technology is extremely significant for
the understanding of our current society.  Student 
interest in this development is intense and if properly
utilized should yield a much better understanding 
of mathematical concepts as well as the ideas of programming
and logical structure which have been introduced 
into many fields by the use of computers.  The present
paper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate 
mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the use
of mathematics by persons who are not professional 
mathematicians be modified to include the extensions
and clarifications which are possible because of 
computers.  An early introduction to programming is
desirable to permit a continuing use of automatic 
computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical concepts.
 Following the calculus equation stage an 
intensive introduction to numerical analysis should
be added to the current curriculum.  In addition 
to providing competence in the mostly used computing
techniques, it would permit a more sophisticated 
utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas associated
with complex variables and transform theories.

Opt <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> mizing the Performance of a Relational Algebra Database Interface

An approach for implementing a "smart" interface
to support a relational view of data is proposed. 
 The basic idea is to employ automatic programming techniques
so that the interface analyzes and efficiently 
refines the high level query specification supplied by
the user.  A relational algebra interface, called 
SQUIRAL, which was designed using this approach, is described
in detail. SQUIRAL seeks to minimize query 
response time and space utilization by: (1) performing
global query optimization, (2) exploiting disjoint 
and pipelined concurrency, (3) coordinating sort orders
in temporary relations, (4) employing directory 
analysis, and (5) maintaining locality in page references.
 Algorithms for implementing the operators 
of E. F. Codd's relational algebra are presented, and
a methodology for composing them to optimize the 
performance of a particular user query is described.

Dynam <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> c Verification of Operating System Decisions

Dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  The dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system
being designed and constructed at the University 
of California, Berkeley.  PRIME is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

Computer Methods for Sampl <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng from
the Exponential and Normal Distributions

Various methods are known for transforming uniformly
distributed random numbers into exponentially
and normally distributed quantities.  The most efficient
ones are compared, in terms of memory requirements 
and speed, with some new algorithms.  A number of procedures
convert Taylor series expansions directly 
into sampling steps, an approach which may be used for
sampling from any continuous distribution.  For 
the exponential distribution a definite recommendation
can be made, whereas in the case of the normal 
distribution there remains a choice between slower and
shorter algorithms and faster but space consuming 
methods.

On Quadrat <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> c Adaptive Routing Algorithms

Two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  These models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  Adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  The form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  The modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  Simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

An axiomatic method for proving a number
of properties of parallel programs is presented.  
Hoare has given a set of axioms for partial correctness,
but they are not strong enough in most cases. 
 This paper defines a more powerful deductive system which
is in some sense complete for partial correctness. 
 A crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,
which are added to a parallel program as 
an aid to proving it correct.  The information in a partial
correctness proof can be used to prove such 
properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock,
and program termination.  Techniques for verifying 
these properties are presented and illustrated by
application to the dining philosophers problem.

On Mult <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> programming, Machine Coding, and Computer Organization

The author feels that the interrupt feature
which is available in most modern computers is 
a potent source of programming pitfalls and errors, and
that it therefore may heavily contribute to the 
unreliability of programs making use of it.  A programming
scheme is presented which avoids the concept 
of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent
(or pseudoconcurrent) activities in a supposedly 
more perspicuous manner.  It is intended to serve as
a basis for the construction of operating systems, 
which are prime examples of programs with concurrent
activities.  The scheme includes a set of basic 
instructions for the generation, termination, and synchronization
of parallel processes.  A set of routines 
representing these instructions and thereby simulating a
hypothetical machine organization has been implemented 
and test on the IBM System/360.  Two programs using these
instructions, written in PL360, are presented.

 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

Subgoal Induct <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> on

A proof method, subgoal induction, is presented
as an alternative or supplement to the commonly 
used inductive assertion method.  Its major virtue is that
it can often be used to prove a loop's correctness 
directly from its input-output specification without the
use of an invariant.  The relation between subgoal 
induction and other commonly used induction rules is explored
and, in particular, it is shown that subgoal 
induction can be viewed as a specialized form of computation
induction.  A set of sufficient conditions 
are presented which guarantee that an input-output specification
is strong enough for the induction steps 
of a proof by subgoal induction to be valid.

A Method for Obta <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ning Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems

An encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  This has two important consequences: (1) 
Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 Only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
A message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  Anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  This 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  A message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising
M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product, n, of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q.  Decryption is similar;only a different,
secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) 
* (q-1)).  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, 
n.

algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally

effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

A Un <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> fying Approach to Scheduling

This paper presents a scheme for classifying
scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model 
of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion of
priority.  Various classes of scheduling algorithms
are defined and related to existing algorithms.  A
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms, which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones.  For time-invariant
algorithms, the dependence of processing rates 
on priorities is derived.  The abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real operating systems.  The policy-driven scheduler
of Bernstein and Sharp is discussed as an example 
of such an implementation

Scan Convers <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> on Algorithms for a Cell Organized Raster Display

Raster scan computer graphics with "real time"
character generators have previously been limited 
to alphanumeric characters.  A display has been described
which extends the capabilities of this organization 
to include general graphics.  Two fundamentally different
scan conversion algorithms which have been 
developed to support this display are presented.  One
is most suitable to non-interactive applications 
and the other to interactive applications.  The algorithms
were implemented in Fortran on the CDC 6400 
computer.  Results obtained from the implementations show
that the noninteractive algorithms can significantly 
reduce display file storage requirements at little cost
in execution time over that of a conventional 
raster display.  The interactive algorithm can improve
response time and reduce storage requirements.

Dynam <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> c Memory Allocation in Computer Simulation

This paper investigates the performance of
35 dynamic memory allocation algorithms when used 
to service simulation programs as represented by 18
test cases.  Algorithm performance was measured in
terms of processing time, memory usage, and external memory
fragmentation.  Algorithms main taining separate 
free space lists for each size of memory block used
tended to perform quite well compared with other 
algorithms.  Simple algorithms operating on memory ordered
lists (without any free list) performed surprisingly 
well.  Algorithms employing power-of-two block sizes
had favorable processing requirements but generally 
unfavorable memory usage.  Algorithms employing LIFO, FIFO,
or memory ordered free lists generally performed 
poorly compared with others.

PLEXUS-An On-Line System  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Modeling Neural Networks

A description is presented of PLEXUS, a system
which enables a user to construct and specify 
a neural network, to analyze the output data produced
by the network, and to store and retrieve networks 
and data from a library.  The system, operated entirely
from a digital display unit, interacts directly 
with the user and permits easy and rapid transitions
between the various phases of the modeling process. 
 PLEXUS is designed to complement neurophysiological research
so that the systematic development of neural 
models can be coordinated with experimental work.  PLEXUS
networks are built up from components representing 
individual neurons, external stimuli, and interconnecting
fibers, each component being of a relatively 
detailed nature.  Provision is also made for the use of
experimental data as input to a network.  Convenient 
means for specification and modification of a network and
extensive error-checking capabilities are provided. 
Data resulting from the simulation of a network may be
analyzed by a variety of techniques ranging from 
examinations of the gross characteristics of the data to
the determination of detailed statistical properties.

A technique  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active digital systems 
is described.  Essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and space, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.  The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.  The passage of
time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous
and asynchronous logic.  Certain aspects 
of the techniques described may be used for the simulation
of network structures other than digital networks.

resulting in two desirable consequences: 
(1) naming constraints disappear even when there is
indirect addressing within function definitions; 
and (2) there is a significant saving in the number of
calls to the garbage collector, because some garbage 
is collected, at little expense, each time a function
returns to its calling program.  These modifications 
have been implemented as an extension to a SNOBOL dialect.

 On the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for
communicating between man and the computer.  In 
applications requiring the processing of a large volume
of inherently decimal input and output data, 
the time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely
binary computer may be significant.  A slower

applications of this principle are given, and it 
is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might
dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to 
gain efficiency.  Allocation of resources is closely connected
to accounting for those resources, raising 
the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead,
and relative weighting of charges for dependent 
resources.  Since weightings may depend on allocation
algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting 
parameters.  Often the only repeatable accounting is
one which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, 
and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges
will result.  Multiprogramming turns on allocation 
of the memory resource essential to control of other
resources.  The general suggestions for allocation 
and accounting are applied to this question, and some
details provided for the case of a monitor which 
controls a virtual-memory machine.

is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing

Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Local Computer Networks

Ethernet is a branching broadcast communication
system for carrying digital data packets among 
locally distributed computing stations. The packet
transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been 
used to build systems which can be viewed as either local
computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. 
 An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether,
is a passive broadcast medium with no central 
control.  Coordination of access to the Ether for packet
broadcasts is distributed among the contending 
transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration.
 Switching of packets to their destinations 
on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations
using packet address recognition.  Design principles 
and implementation are described, based on experience
with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a 
kilometer of coaxial cable.  A model for estimating performance
under heavy loads and a packet protocol 
for error controlled communication are included for completeness.

This paper presents a new file  <strong style='color:blue;''>addressing</strong>  method
based on the calculation of an address from 
the identification of a record.  For large recirculating
type files, it seems to be more advantageous 
than customary ones.  The probability distribution of
the displacement of records from their calculated 
address, which is one less than the number of probes
required to address a record, is computed on the 
basis of a Markov chain model.  For the reader not interested

(interpreted relative to the location counter) or full

have many mutual references in such a computer, 
there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping
as many of the addresses short as possible.  This 
paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems of
this type can be formulated as covering problems

are allocated among the user community.  One means that is suggested
more and more frequently is a pricing procedure.  In this
paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources
is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold 
is discussed.  Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at 
times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted 
flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources.  Consideration is 
also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful 
effects of frequent price fluctuations.  Although the subject of pricing has
been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions
persist about its purpose and its operation.  An attempt is made to clarify 
some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and 
disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing. Two

One of the suggested means  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  stimulating the
spread of computing capabilities in institutions 
of higher learning is through the construction of regional
computing networks.  One such network has 
been constructed in the San Francisco Bay Area by Stanford
University.  This paper reports upon the lessons 
learned from the operation of the network over the past
two years.  A major impact of the network was 
not so much the computer power delivered to the schools
as the awakening of computing awareness and the 
fostering of capability development at these schools. The
expertise and assistance from the central facility
as well as the sharing of ideas among the participants
were other important benefits.  Both the quality 
and variety of services provided by the central facility
were found to play a key role in the effectiveness 
of the network.  A regional network brings many benefits
and should not be judged as a purveyor of raw 
computer power alone.

situation in which  <strong style='color:blue;''>resources</strong>  have been allocated 
to various tasks in such a way that none of the tasks
can continue.  The various published solutions 
have been somewhat restrictive: either they do not handle
the problem in sufficient generality or they 
suggest policies which will on occasion refuse a request
which could have been safely granted.  Algorithms 
are presented which examine a request in the light of
the current allocation of resources and determine 
whether or not the granting of the request will introduce
the possibility of a deadlock.  Proofs given

An extended  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong> m of semantic network is defined, which can
be regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic.
By virtue of its relationship with logic, the extended
semantic network is provided with a precise semantics,
inference rules, and a procedural interpretation.  On
the other hand, by regarding semantic networks as an 
abstract data structure for the representation of clauses, we provide a
theorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-following
strategy for guiding the search for a proof.

 Detection and/or prevention of deadlocks can require
massive amounts of additional overhead if efficient

management program is described which uses linked 
lists along with other techniques to overcome a large
portion of this overhead.  The program, which is 
currently running as part of a large scale general purpose
operating system, keeps resources relatively 
active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocks
in its implemented state.  Certain changes, which 
would permit more comprehensive levels of deadlock
prevention/detection at additional cost, have not 
been incorporated in the running system due
to the infrequency of deadlock situations.

Dynamic Response Time Prediction  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Computer Networks

If the ultimate aim of a computing network
is resource sharing, then the human component as 
well as the technical component of networking must
be fully investigated to achieve this goal.  This 
research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating
in the vast store of resources available 
on a network. Analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
evaluation tools are employed to investigate 
the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor
that is capable of providing comparative response 
time information for users wishing to process various
computing applications at some network computing 
node.  The research clearly reveals that sufficient
system data are currently obtainable, at least for 
the five diverse ARPA network systems studied in detail,
to describe and predict the response time for 
network time-sharing systems as it depends on some
measure of system activity or load level.

Capability-Based Addressing

Various  <strong style='color:blue;''>addressing schemes</strong>  making use of segment
tables are examined.  The inadequacies of 
these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are
explained. These inadequacies are traced to the 
lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in
these systems.  The direct use of a capability as 
an address is shown to overcome these difficulties
because it provides the needed absolute address.  
Implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 It is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  A hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  The hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  A computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

New LISP Techniques for a Pag <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Environment

The system described herein employs the block
concept, and that of global and local variables, 
in addition to the methods applied in most LISP systems.
 Also, a new means of list representation is 
used: "local sequential" for lists created during compilation,
and "block level sequential" for those 
created dynamically.  A new garbage collection algorithm
has been introduced to make lists as compact 
as possible; partial garbage collection is performed after
each block exit instead of total garbage collection 
when storage is exhausted.  The algorithm does not use
the customary flagging procedure.  This combination 
of features has eliminated the need for a free list,
and effectively minimizes the number of pages used 
at any moment.

PLEXUS-An On-L <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> e System for Modeling Neural Networks

A description is presented of PLEXUS, a system
which enables a user to construct and specify 
a neural network, to analyze the output data produced
by the network, and to store and retrieve networks 
and data from a library.  The system, operated entirely
from a digital display unit, interacts directly 
with the user and permits easy and rapid transitions
between the various phases of the modeling process. 
 PLEXUS is designed to complement neurophysiological research
so that the systematic development of neural 
models can be coordinated with experimental work.  PLEXUS
networks are built up from components representing 
individual neurons, external stimuli, and interconnecting
fibers, each component being of a relatively 
detailed nature.  Provision is also made for the use of
experimental data as input to a network.  Convenient 
means for specification and modification of a network and
extensive error-checking capabilities are provided. 
Data resulting from the simulation of a network may be
analyzed by a variety of techniques ranging from 
examinations of the gross characteristics of the data to
the determination of detailed statistical properties.

Optimal Program and Data Locations  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Computer Networks

An optimization procedure for the allocation
of program and data files in a computer network 
is presented.  This algorithm takes into account the
dependencies between files and programs such as 
occur in real heterogeneous computer networks.  Insights
into whether or not to convert programs from 
one computer to another can also be gained from the
model.  A search procedure for the file location 
problem is described, along with an example
and a possible application of the model.

Exclusive Simulation of Activity  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Digital Networks

A technique for simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active digital systems 
is described.  Essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and space, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.  The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.  The passage of
time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous
and asynchronous logic.  Certain aspects 
of the techniques described may be used for the simulation
of network structures other than digital networks.

The tendency towards increased parallelism in
computers is noted.  Exploitation of this parallelism 
presents a number of new problems in machine design
and in programming systems.  Minimum requirements 
for successful concurrent execution of several independent
problem programs are discussed.  These requirements 
are met in the STRETCH system by a carefully balanced
combination of built-in and programmed logic.  
Techniques are described which place the burden of the
programmed logic on system programs (supervisory 
program and compiler) rather than on problem programs.

Network

In order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot
Potato Heuristic Routing Doctrine."  A correctness 
proof of this Topology Information Protocol is also presented.

Time, Clocks, and the Order <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g of Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.
 A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing 
a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally
order the events.  The use of the total ordering 
is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization
problems.  The algorithm is then specialized 
for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived
on how far out of synchrony the clocks can 
become.

In many computer  <strong style='color:blue;''>operating systems</strong>  a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  The system compares
this password with one recorded in a Password 
Table which is available to only the authentication
program.  The integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  In this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    All aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  The scheme is based
on using a function H which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  This function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  The intruder may know all about H and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert H to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  This paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable H.  Two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  Finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming
languages.  Based on primitive notions of module, message,

Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switch <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g for Local Computer Networks

Ethernet is a branching broadcast communication
system for carrying digital data packets among 
locally distributed computing stations. The packet
transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been 
used to build systems which can be viewed as either local
computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. 
 An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether,
is a passive broadcast medium with no central 
control.  Coordination of access to the Ether for packet
broadcasts is distributed among the contending 
transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration.
 Switching of packets to their destinations 
on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations
using packet address recognition.  Design principles 
and implementation are described, based on experience
with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a 
kilometer of coaxial cable.  A model for estimating performance
under heavy loads and a packet protocol 
for error controlled communication are included for completeness.

any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases 
as the square of the work required of the two communicants

Theoretical Considerations  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Information Retrieval Systems

Information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  For identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  Two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  One is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being 
relevant.

On Quadratic Adaptive Rout <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Algorithms

Two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  These models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  Adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  The form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  The modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  Simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

The Merit of Regional Comput <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Networks

One of the suggested means for stimulating the
spread of computing capabilities in institutions 
of higher learning is through the construction of regional
computing networks.  One such network has 
been constructed in the San Francisco Bay Area by Stanford
University.  This paper reports upon the lessons 
learned from the operation of the network over the past
two years.  A major impact of the network was 
not so much the computer power delivered to the schools
as the awakening of computing awareness and the 
fostering of capability development at these schools. The
expertise and assistance from the central facility
as well as the sharing of ideas among the participants
were other important benefits.  Both the quality 
and variety of services provided by the central facility
were found to play a key role in the effectiveness 
of the network.  A regional network brings many benefits
and should not be judged as a purveyor of raw 
computer power alone.

A Modular Computer Shar <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g System

An alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  The system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  One of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  In the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  A crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 Thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 This system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  Economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  Finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

Model <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g and Simulation of Digital Networks

The simulation of digital networks on a digital
computer provides the engineer with an effective 
means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior.  The
digital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent 
or time-independent Boolean transformations; each transformation
describing the input-output relationship 
of a model element comprising the network mode.  The
simplicity of utilizing the FORTRAN IV Programming 
System as a digital Network Simulator is discussed an
illustrated.  This simplicity is derived from a 
common modeling technique applicable to combinational
and sequential digital networks and a systematic 
programming approach.

Some Theorems to Aid  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Solving the File Allocation Problem

The file allocation problem-i.e. the problem
of finding the optimal set of network sites at 
which to locate copies of a file-is known to be, in general,
polynomial complete.  Heuristics and other 
aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal, solutions are
therefore much needed.  In this paper we present 
three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate
that certain sites should (or should not) be 
included in an optimal allocation.

On Simulat <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Networks of Parallel Processes
in Which Simultaneous Events May Occur

Some of the problems of simulating discrete
event systems, particularly computer systems, on 
a conventional digital computer are dealt with.  The
systems are assumed to be described as a network 
of interconnected sequential processes.  Briefly reviewed
are the common techniques used to handle such 
simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, can
be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority 
rules.  Following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous
events in separate processes is introduced. 
 An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems.  The technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found.  In some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending 
the information available to the solution technique, but
in many cases the technique becomes computationally 
unfeasible when the additional information is provided.

Management Utilization of Computers  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  American Local Governments

Traditional concepts of management information
systems (MIS) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most US local
governments.  What exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  Despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  Management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  Finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly
involving improvements in decision information.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-3077.html</h3><br/><p>	Algebra 
of Programs

Conventional programming  <strong style='color:blue;''>languages</strong>  are growing
ever more enormous, but not stronger.  Inherent 
defects at the most basic level cause them to be both
fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style 
of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the
von Neumann computer, their close coupling off 
semantics to state transitions, their division of programming
into a world of expressions and a world 
of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs 
from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical
properties for reasoning about programs. An 
alternative functional style of programming is founded
on the use of combining forms for creating programs. 
 Functional programs deal with structured data, are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically 
constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
use high level programs to build still higher level
ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.
 Associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms. 
 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written.  Combining 
forms are chosen not only for their programming power
but also for the power of their associated algebraic 
laws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed
behavior and termination conditions for large 
classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems
uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems 
have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one
state transition occurs per major computation.

Most current programming  <strong style='color:blue;''>languages</strong>  treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  The 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions. 
In particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  An application 
to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

Dijkstra, Knuth, and others.  Solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors.  The algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time.  A realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted.  A procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time O(k log
n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k an arbitrary 
integer.  The model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2851.html</h3><br/><p>	of Parallel Programs

Two formal models  <strong style='color:blue;''>for parallel computation</strong> 
are presented: an abstract conceptual model and 
a parallel-program model.  The former model does not
distinguish between control and data states.  The 
latter model includes the capability for the representation
of an infinite set of control states by allowing 
there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or
processes) executing the program.  An induction 
principle is presented which treats the control and
data state sets on the same ground.  Through the 
use of "place variables," it is observed that certain
correctness conditions can be expressed without 
enumeration of the set of all possible control states.
 Examples are presented in which the induction 
principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion.
 It is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle.
A special case of the assertions method, which 
is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be
incomplete.  A formalization of "deadlock" is then 
presented. The concept of a "norm" is introduced, which
yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, 
of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
and permits shared global variables.  Correctness 
of certain forms of implementation is also discussed.
 An Appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  processing algorithm for shrinking
binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, 
one for each pattern, is presented.  This procedure
may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and 
a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large
scale integrated technology is envisioned.  The 
principal features of this method are the very small
window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel 
nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking
any pattern, regardless of the complexity of 
its configuration.  Problems regarding merging and disconnection
of patterns during the process as well 
as the determination of the maximum number of steps
necessary to obtain a single isolated element from 
a pattern, are reviewed and discussed.  An analogy with a
neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts 
"neurons" is presented.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2865.html</h3><br/><p>	method for proving a number
of properties of  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  programs is presented.  
Hoare has given a set of axioms for partial correctness,
but they are not strong enough in most cases. 
 This paper defines a more powerful deductive system which
is in some sense complete for partial correctness. 
 A crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,
which are added to a parallel program as 
an aid to proving it correct.  The information in a partial
correctness proof can be used to prove such 
properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock,
and program termination.  Techniques for verifying 
these properties are presented and illustrated by
application to the dining philosophers problem.

processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

computability theory.  Programming  <strong style='color:blue;''>languages</strong>  offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

When proving that a  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i.e. that the statement
cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program. 
 Here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that
the assumption that a statement is indivisible 
can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as
halting.  Thus correctness proofs of a parallel 
system can often be greatly simplified.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong> -processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when N processors are applied approaches
1/N times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

 This paper reviews the hardware characteristics 
of the ILLIAC and singles out unconventional features
which could be expected to influence language (and 
compiler) design.  The implications of these features for
data layout and algorithm structure are discussed, 
and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation rather than
code structuring is the crucial ILLIAC optimization 
problem.  A satisfactory method of data allocation is
then presented.  Language structures to utilize 
this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described.

time can be minimized only if consideration is given to
the ordering of the subexpressions.  In particular, 
subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing
memory and processor time requirements.  This 
observation is valid for configurations ranging from
a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to 
multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory.  If the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in 
parallel exceeds the number of available processors,
then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed.  A procedure is given which combines this
requirement with the earlier ordering considerations 
to provide an optimal execution sequence.

 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written.  Combining

uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems

proved to be  <strong style='color:blue;''>very</strong>  helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

The paper investigates how the special structure of matrices can be described
and utilized for efficient computing by saving memory space and
superfluous operations.  Sequences of Matrices (and sequences of sequences
of matrices) are considered, and matrix operators areext
ended to sequence operators and cumulative operators.  Algorithms
are given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so
as to find the forms best suited for computation.  These forms are
called normal forms.  Several completeness results are obtained
in the sense that for each expression an equivalent expression
in normal form can be found within a specified calculus.

in a  <strong style='color:blue;''>high level</strong>  language are correctly translated 
to a low level language is described.  A primary use of
the system is as a post optimization step in code 
generation.  The low level language programs need not
be generated by a compiler and in fact could be 
hand coded.  Examples of the usefulness of such a system
are given.  Some interesting results are the 
ability to handle programs that implement recursion by
bypassing the start of the program, and the detection 
and pinpointing of a wide class of errors in the low
level language programs.  The examples demonstrate 
that optimization of the genre of this paper can result
in substantially faster operation and the saving 
of memory in terms of program and stack sizes.

COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed
to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; 
it is an  extension of Fortran with graphic-type variables,
so that the designer who is familiar with Fortran need not learn a new 
language.  The application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications.

in termediate text,  <strong style='color:blue;''>high</strong> -level data flow analysis 
deals with programs essentially at source level and
exploits the control flow information implicit in 
the parse tree.  The need for high-level flow analysis
arises from several aspects of recent work on 
advanced methods of program certification and optimization.
 This paper proposes a simple general method 
of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use
of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs 
when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of
data flow information to reflect program changes, 
and derives new global information helpful in solving
many familiar global flow analysis problems.  An 
illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented.
 Many of the graphs involved are constructed 
and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus avoiding
certain costs that low-level methods incur 
repeatedly at compile time.

This paper describes a  <strong style='color:blue;''>high level</strong>  and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT, 
which provides very powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities. Its design is based 
on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables
the users to visualize the translation processes, 
and thus makes data translation a much simpler task. 
"CONVERT" has been chosen for conveying the purpose 
of the language and should not be confused with any
other language or program bearing the same name.

matter how large, complex or time consuming-must 
operate under (or, more precisely, on top of) the standard
system.  Large applications require supervisory 
monitors which handle problems similar to those of
the operating systems, but at a different level.  
Sometimes, still a third or even a fourth such level
is required or desirable.  This leads naturally 
to the concept of multilevel systems-similar vertically,
but different horizontally.  Proper division 
of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency and
less logical complexity, while actually 
enhancing capability.

is characterized by the fact that several hundred different
methods are available to analyze documents

process by leaving the exact sequence of 
operations initially unspecified, and adapting the
search strategy to the needs of individual users. 
 The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating
environment, but also to test the effectiveness 
of the various available processing methods.  Results obtained
so far seem to indicate that some combination 
of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to
retrieve the wanted information.  A typical search 
request is used as an example in the present report to illustrate
systems operations and evaluation procedures.

The 1100 series  <strong style='color:blue;''>systems</strong>  are Sperry Univac's
large-scale main frame computer systems.  Beginning 
with the 1107 in 1962, the 1100 series has progressed
through a succession of eight compatible computer 
models to the latest system, the 1100/80, introduced
in 1977.  The 1100 series hardware architecture 
is based on a 36-bit word, ones complement structure

 The two functions are discussed in terms of the 
same basic concepts in order to identify the extent
to which they overlap. It is suggested that there 
is some similarity between the idea of a file directory
and a storable object of type context.  Manipulations 
with contexts are then discussed at length.  It is noted
that there is a simple extension of Church's 
Lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of
context manipulation.  Whereas a function can be 
regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
the expression Lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), 
it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction
based upon the first two terms in the equivalent 
expression Mu(name list)(value list)(expression).

Extremely  <strong style='color:blue;''>portable</strong>  subroutines are sometimes
needed for which moderate quality and efficiency 
suffice.  Typically, this occurs for library functions
(like random number generation and in core sorting) 
which are not entirely universal or are not used in a
standardized way.  The literature on random number 
generators does not seem to contain an algorithm that
meets requirements of this sort.  An extremely 
portable 8-line FORTRAN program is provided which based
on an important paper by Coveyou and MacPherson 
(1967)sing their methods, Fourier analysis is applied
to the probability function for the consecutive 
n-tuples provided by our generator (with n less than
or equal to 4).  While the small modulus which must 
be used to maintain portability prevents the quality
of the generator from being high, the generator 
compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper.

implemented in a  <strong style='color:blue;''>portable</strong>  form.  A popular way of 
accomplishing this is to encode the software in a specially
designed machine-independent language and 
then to map this language, often using a macro processor,
into the assembly language of each desired 
object machine.  The design of the machine-independent
language is the key factor in this operation. 
 This paper discusses the relative merits of pitching
this language at a high level or a low level, and 
presents some comparative results.

with respect to  <strong style='color:blue;''>operating</strong>  system performance 
is given.  While a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed, 
gaps still exist in out knowledge.  Because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system, an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future. 
 Such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems.

A Vector Space Model  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Automatic Indexing

In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  An approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

Applications in Online Systems

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>code</strong>  has been specifically designed to simplify
the internal information processing operations 
within an online computer system with respect to non-numeric
applications, and to maximize the transfer 
rate of the information channel linking the system and
the system user.  The code has direct application 
to problems in area such as information retrieval, document
classification, computer-aided teaching and 
text editing.  This code, called IPC (Information Processing
Code), is an 8-bit code set constructed 
so that 7, 6, 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived
from the basic set.  The code set is organized 
so that simple binary operations can distinguish between
the numeric alphabetic, special symbol and control 
character codes.  The number of usable characters within
the basic set size may be expanded either by 
use of escape codes included in the set, or by suitable
interpretation of otherwise unassigned codes 
on the basis of the requirements of local environments.

lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  Each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

saved by using queueing techniques and extensive

 Since the preprocessor and this language associated with

information from that associated with conventional methods.  The reduction in 
space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident
hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

Representations  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Space Planning

Problems involving the arrangement of objects in two- 
or three-space where the objective function primarily consists
of derivatives of the distance between objects or their arrangement
are called space planning problems.  The representational
requirements for this problem area are defined and compared with current
computer graphic languages.  Four alternative data structures
that allow automated space planning are described and compared.

When the space allocation for a hash- <strong style='color:blue;''>code</strong> d table
is altered, the table entries must be rescattered 
over the new space.  A technique for accomplishing
this rescattering is presented.  The technique is 
independent of both the length of the table and the hashing
function used, and can be utilized in conjunction 
with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered.
 Moreover, it can be used to eliminate previously 
flagged deletions from any hash-coded table, or to change
from one hashing method to another.  The efficiency 
of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given.

that is, with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the Code.  The manner of use of these 
characters has not previously been completely described.
 This paper presents a set of mutually consistent 
philosophies regarding code extension applications,
and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the 
application of the code extension characters.  Distinctions
are drawn between code extension and such 
other concepts as "graphic substitution" or "syntactic
representation" which are often used to meet similar 
requirements.  Also covered are certain topics which
are not truly concerned with code extension but 
which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications.
 The material in this paper is equally 
applicable in principle to the (proposed) ISO international
7-bit code for information interchange.

a series of experiments were per <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong> med in order 
to obtain better data on the relative performance of
first-fit and best-fit and a better understanding 
of the reasons underlying observed differences. The
time-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and 
best-fit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each
other.  Except for small populations, the size 
of the request population had little effect on allocation
efficiency.  For exponential and hyperexponential 
distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit;
but for normal and uniform distributions, 
and for exponential distributions distorted in various
ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit.  It is 
hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit,
it does so because first-fit, by preferentially 
allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks
to grow at the other end.  Sufficient contiguous 
space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively
large requests.  Results of simulation experiments 
supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative
performance of first-fit and best-fit depends 
on the frequency of request.  When the coefficient of
variation of the request distribution is greater 
than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit.

In this descriptive article an input  <strong style='color:blue;''>code</strong> 
is presented which greatly simplifies data input 
to any linear programming solution routine, for subsequent
use either as a pedagogical device or for 
solving rather small LP problems.  This latter (limited)
use derives not at all from inherent limitations 
in the code itself, but from an efficiency evaluation:
large LP problems would doubtless benefit from 
an input system more suited for bulk data handling than
the input code described.  From a user's standpoint, 
input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation
of the LP problem (limited only by a keypunch's 
inability to write subscripts, etc.).  The input interpreter
scans column wise, thus no fixed format 
data preparation is required.  The user may also, under
very general requirements only, liberally use 
editorial comments throughout the input deck as an
aid in identification, e.g., of row constraints.  
The article includes examples of input, output from a
solution routine presently in use, and a skeleton 
flowchart of the input interpreter.

 The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.  Then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied. 
 Some measurements of line efficiency for the ARPANET are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements 
are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network.
Similar results are derived for a recently 
proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system.

program behavior, and processor efficiency 
in computer systems is presented.  Concepts of value and
cost of space allocation per task are defined

 It also has many applications in numerical

is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) 
= n.  In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of A.  In the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

Algorithms

Two new  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms for</strong>  deriving optimal and
near-optimal flowcharts from limited entry decision 
tables are presented.  Both take into account rule frequencies
and the time needed to test conditions. 
 One of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding algorithm,
leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes 
execution time for a decision table in which simple rules
are already contracted to complex rules.  The 
other one, called the optimum-approaching algorithm, requires
many fewer calculations but does not necessarily 
produce the optimum flowchart.  The algorithms are first
derived for treating decision tables not containing 
an ELSE-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm
is shown to be equally valid for tables including 
such a rule.  Both algorithms are compared with existing
ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision 
table derived from a real case.  From this comparison two
conclusions are drawn.  (1) The optimum-approaching 
algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable
existing ones and will not require more, 
but usually less, computation time.(2) In general, the
greater computation effort needed for applying 
the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified
by the small reduction in execution time obtained.

A parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors.  The algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time.  A realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted.  A procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time O(k log
n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k an arbitrary 
integer.  The model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location.

this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching
 computer network include (1) transmission 
of separately addressed packets. (2) multidestination

tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding.  To
this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path 
forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits
routing procedures and data structures already 
available for packet switching.  Reverse path forwarding
is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing 
 in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks.
 The algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
for its analysis in this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity
than that required for the known alternatives.

A new algorithm is presented for  <strong style='color:blue;''>find</strong> ing all
primes between 2 and n.  The algorithm executes 
in time proportional to n (assuming that multiplication
of integers not larger than n can be performed 
in unit time).  The method has the same arithmetic complexity
as the algorithm presented by Mairson [6]; 
however, our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant.
 It is also easily extended to find the prime 
factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n.

Convex Hulls  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Finite Sets of Poin ts in Two and Three Dimensions

The convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in two
and three dimensions can be determined with O(n 
log n) operations.  The presented algorithms use the "divide
and conquer" technique and recursively apply 
a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls.
 Since any convex hull algorithm requires at 
least O(n log n) operations, the time complexity of the
proposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative

 Classical  <strong style='color:blue;''>implementations of</strong>  list processing systems
lack this property because allocating a list cell 
from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process
requires time proportional to the heap size 
to finish.  A real-time list processing system is presented
which continuously reclaims garbage, including 
directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the
accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid 
fragmenting the free storage pool.  The program is small
and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making 
it suitable for microcode.  Finally, the system requires
the same average time, and not more than twice 
the space, of a classical implementation, and those
space requirements can be reduced to approximately 
classical proportions by compact list representation.
 Arrays of different sizes, a program stack, and 
hash linking are simple extensions to our system, and
reference counting is found to be inferior for 
many applications.

This paper investigates the problem  <strong style='color:blue;''>of optimal</strong> 
his togram matching using monotone gray level 
transformation, which always assigns all picture points
of a given gray level i to another gray level 
T(i) such that if i > j, then T(i) > T(j).  The objective
is to find a transformed digital picture of 
a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors
between the gray level his togram of the transformed 
picture and that of a reference picture is minimized.
 This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered 
objects of different sized one by one into k2 linearly ordered
boxes of assorted sizes, such that the 
accumulated error of space under packed or overpacked
in the boxes is minimized; the placement function 
is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution
to this problem.  A tree search algorithm for 
optimal his togram matching is presented which has time
complexity O(k1 x k2).  If the monotone property 
is dropped, then the problem becomes NP-complete,
even if it is restricted to k2 = 2.

and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations

A Fast and Usu <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> y Linear Algorithm for Global
Flow Analysis (Abstract only--Complete paper JACM 
23,1 January, 1976)

A new algorithm for global flow analysis on
reducible graphs is presented. The algorithm is 
shown to treat a very general class of function spaces.
 For a graph of e edges, the algorithm has a 
worst case time bound of O(e log e) function operations.
 It is also shown that in programming terms, 
the number of operations is proportional to e plus the
number of exits from program loops.  Consequently 
a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures
linearity.  The algorithm can be extended to yet 
larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing
the time bound.  Examples are given of code 
improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.

and applied to give a significant variation of the Goodman-Lance

The resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution

Quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation
is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context.

An Extension  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Fibonaccian Search To Several Variables

A technique which uses Fibonaccian search
concepts has been developed to solve optimization 
problems involving unimodal functions of several variables.
 The technique has not been proven to be 
optimal in the sense that the one-dimensional Fibonaccian
search is.  However, it is valuable for certain 
kinds of calculations.

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>optimization of</strong>  time-shared system performance
requires the description of the stochastic 
processes governing the user inputs and the program activity.
 This paper provides a statistical description 
of the user input process in the SDC-ARPA general-purpose
Time-Sharing System (TSS).  The input process 
is assumed to be stationary, and to be defined by the
interarrival time distribution.  The data obtained 
appear to justify satisfactorily the common assumption
that the interarrival times are serially independent. 
 The data do not appear to justify, except as a very
rough approximation, the usual assumption off an 
exponential distribution for interarrival time.  A much
more satisfactory approximation to the data can 
be obtained with a biphase or triphase hyperexponential distribution.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2897.html</h3><br/><p>	developments in optimizing techniques
have  <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> owed a new design for compilers to emerge. 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into
lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  Each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost

general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed
twice on a given execution path.  Such computations are termed partially
redundant.  Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical
information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph.
Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly
linear with the size of the program, and that it leads
to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.

A Comparison of List Schedules for Par <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> el Processing Systems

The problem of scheduling two or more processors
to minimize the execution time of a program 
which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks
is studied.  Cases where task execution times are 
deterministic and others in which execution times are
random variables are analyzed.  It is shown that 
different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly
in execution time and that the B-schedule 
of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal.  A dynamic programming
solution for the case in which execution 
times are random variables is presented.

is unique in that it can compute all of this

a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

and derives new global information helpful in solving
many familiar global flow analysis problems.  An

 Many of the graphs involved are constructed

This paper is a practical study  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  how to
implement the Quicksort sorting algorithm and its 
best variants on real computers, including how to apply
various code optimization techniques.  A detailed 
implementation combining the most effective improvements
to Quicksort is given, along with a discussion 
of how to implement it in assembly language.  Analytic
results describing the performance of the programs 
are summarized.  A variety of special situations are considered
from a practical standpoint to illustrate 
Quicksort's wide applicability as an internal sorting
method which requires negligible extra storage.

Object code Optimization

Methods  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  analyzing the control flow and data
flow of programs during compilation are applied 
to transforming the program to improve object time efficiency.
 Dominance relationships, indicating which 
statements are necessarily executed before others, are
used to do global common expression elimination 
and loop identification.  Implementation of these and other
optimizations in OS/360 FORTRAN H are described.

SITAR, a low-cost in teractive text handling
and text analysis system for nontechnical users, 
is in many ways comparable to in teractive bibliographical
search and retrieval systems, but has several 
additional features. It is implemented on a PDP/11 time-sharing
computer invoked by a CRT with microprogrammed 
editing functions.  It uses a simple command language designating
a function, a file, and a search template 
consisting of the textual string desired and strings
delimiting the context in which the hit is to be 
delivered.  Extensive experience with SITAR shows that
the combined powers of simple commands, string 
orientation, circular file structure, a CRT with local
memory, and conversational computing produce a 
system much more powerful than the sum of its parts.

These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The
basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,
and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

implement by dynamic storage  <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> ocation with linked
blocks for each activation, but rather expensive 
in both time and space.  This paper presents an implementation
technique using a single stack to hold 
procedure activation storage which allows retention
of that storage for durations not necessarily tied 
to control flow.  The technique has the property that,
in the simple case,it runs identically to the 
usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure.
 Applications of this technique to multitasking, 
coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and
functional arguments are discussed.  In the initial 
model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation
assumes multiple-processes coordinate 
by passing control explicitly to one another.  A multiprocessor
implementation requires only a few changes 
to the basic technique, as described.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2622.html</h3><br/><p>	Secrecy in the Computer

In many computer  <strong style='color:blue;''>operating systems</strong>  a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  The system compares
this password with one recorded in a Password 
Table which is available to only the authentication
program.  The integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  In this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    All aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  The scheme is based
on using a function H which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  This function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  The intruder may know all about H and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert H to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  This paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable H.  Two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  Finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

 The program is  <strong style='color:blue;''>based on</strong>  a direct statement of 
Fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate
equation to provide a "bookkeeping law" to follow 
the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a
way that the computer continually stores the heat 
distribution.  A computer analysis method is here regarded
as one in which the physical laws of a process 
are used explicitly in the program. Usually this results
in by passing much of the mathematical procedures 
conventionally used.  The program was tested against
some known exact solutions of the heat equation 
and gave identical results, and compared well with experimental
data of a known biochemical reaction. 
 The construction of computer programs based on the direct
statement of the physical laws is a principle 
of general applicability which has been applied
to several other physical phenomena.

On the Meaning  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Names in Programming Systems

It is assumed that there is a similarity of
function between the data names of a programming 
language and the file names of an operating system.
 The two functions are discussed in terms of the 
same basic concepts in order to identify the extent
to which they overlap. It is suggested that there 
is some similarity between the idea of a file directory
and a storable object of type context.  Manipulations 
with contexts are then discussed at length.  It is noted
that there is a simple extension of Church's 
Lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of
context manipulation.  Whereas a function can be 
regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
the expression Lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), 
it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction
based upon the first two terms in the equivalent 
expression Mu(name list)(value list)(expression).

The basic approach is to  <strong style='color:blue;''>find</strong>  a termination function  that maps
the values of the program variables into some well-founded set,
such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced
throughout the computation.  All too often, the termination functions required 
are difficult to find and are of a complexity out
of proportion to the program under consideration. Multisets (bags)
over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences
of elements taken from S.  The given ordering on S induces
an ordering on the finite multisets over S.  This multiset ordering
is shown to be well-founded.  The multiset ordering enables the
use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise
difficult termination proofs.  In particular, the multiset
ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems,
programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules.

as Lisp that  <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> ocates storage automatically from a
heap, and does not require the programmer to give 
any indication that particular items are no longer useful
or accessible.  A reference count scheme for 
reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing,
compacting, copying scheme to reorganize 
all storage at the users discretion are proposed.  The
algorithms are designed to work well in systems 
which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual
address space.  They depend on the fact that 
most cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference
counts need only be accurate when storage 
is about to be reclaimed.  A transaction file stores changes
to reference counts, and a multiple reference 
table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once.

a structure,  <strong style='color:blue;''>based on</strong>  identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  Furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

is a conceptu <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> y simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  One of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  In the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  A crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 Thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 This system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  Economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  Finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

changing technologies of hardware and software 
systems.  It is difficult, therefore, to base decisions
on experience; in most instances, the benefits 
of comparable experience for a given problem situation

model of the Lockheed Central Computer Center is formulated
that describes the operation of a computation

 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

 In such a situation, we must find a set of assumptions
which simplify the problem greatly, but which 
still provide a basis for considering all significant
cost elements. This paper presents such a first, 
quantitative allocation step.  It considers many of the
significant detailed costs of system utilization, 
data storage, data staging, and data migration.  Although
many avenues of further improvement are available, 
the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate.
As such, it can aid in quantifying the problems

High Speed Compilation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Efficient Object Code

A three-pass compiler with the following properties
is briefly described:  The last two passes 
scan an intermediate language produced by the preceding
pass in essentially the reverse of the order 
in which it was generated, so that the first pass is the
only one which hasto read the bulky problem-oriented 
input.  The double scan, one in either direction, performed
by the first two passes, allows the compiler 
to remove locally constant expressions and recursively
calculable expressions from loops and to do the 
important part of common subexpression recognition.
 Optimization such as the effective use of index 
registers, although as important, is not discussed since
the object code which would be most efficient 
is highly machine dependent.  The discussion is in terms
of a FORTRAN-like language, although the technique 
is applicable to most algebraic languages.

Some Effects  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  the 6600 Computer on Language Structures*

The problem of compiling efficient 6600 codes
prompted the development of an intermediate language 
reflecting the structure of the machine, that is more
easily manipulated in improving object program 
efficiency.  The subject of this paper is the intermediate
language and methods of manipulating it.  
Compilations of a series of arithmetic statements are
discussed.  It is assumed that all functions and 
exponentials have been removed from these statements,
and replaced by simple variables.  For purposes 
of simplicity the treatment of subscripts is ignored. 
A simplified 6600 structure is presented to illustrate
the compiling method.  Several assumptions are made
for purposes of simplification, although there are 
cases in which the assumptions are violated in the actual machine.

A Microprogrammed Implementation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  EULER on IBM System/360 Model 30

An experimental processing system for the algorithmic
language EULER has been implemented in 
microprogramming on an IBM System/360 Model 30 using a
second Read-Only Storage unit.  The system consists 
of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammed
String Language Interpreter, and of an I/O control 
program written in 360 machine language.  The system is described
and results are given in terms of microprogram 
and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter
performance obtained.  The role of microprogramming 
is stressed, which opens a new dimension in the processing
of interpretive code.  The structure and content 
of a higher level language can be matched by an appropriate
interpretive language which can be executed 
efficiently by microprograms on existing computer hardware.

 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

Preliminary Investigation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Techniques
for Automated Reading of Unformatted Text

Methods for converting unstructured printed
material into computer code are experimentally 
investigated.  An operator-controlled mode, depending
on human demarcation of the various regions of 
the page for guiding the scanner, is implemented by
means of a joystick and a CRT display.  This mode, 
for which some performance figures are obtained, is thought
to be suitable for processing very complicated 
material, such as technical journals.  For simpler material,
for instance the "claims" sections of patents, 
and in applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary,
an unsupervised mode is advocated.  Here, 
the textual portions of the page are located during
a rapid prescan by a rudimentary form of frequency 
analysis.  These areas are then rescanned at a higher
resolution suitable for character recognition. 
 Error rates of the order of 0.1 percent are obtained in
a simple problem involving photographs of telephone 
company meter boards.  Other matters related to the
design of a general purpose page reader, such as 
the segmentation of printed text, the possibility of
time-sharing the scanner, interactive man-machine 
operation, and the facsimile reproduction of illustrations, are discussed.

An  <strong style='color:blue;''>optimization</strong>  technique known as inline substitution
is analyzed.  The optimization consists 
of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copy
of the procedure body.  The general problem of 
using inline substitution to minimize execution time
subject to size constrain ts is formulated, and an 
approximate algorithmic solution is proposed.  The algorithm
depends on run-time statistics about the 
program to be optimized.  Preliminary results for the
CLU structured programming language indicate that, 
in programs with a low degree of recursion, over 90
percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated, 
with little increase in the size of compiled code and a
small savings in execution time.  Other conclusions 
based on these results are also presented.

Automatic Generation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Efficient Lexical
Processors Using Finite State Techniques

The practical application of the theory of
finite-state automata to automatically generate 
lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article
by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed 
at M. as part of the AED-1 system.  This system
accepts as input description of the multicharacter 
items or of words allowable in a language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

Implications  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Structured Programming for Machine Architecture

Based on an empirical study of more than 10,000
lines of program text written in a GOTO-less 
language, a machine architecture specifically designed for
structured programs is proposed.  Since assignment, 
CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for
93 percent of all executable statements, special 
care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented
efficiently.  A highly compact instruction 
encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program
size by a factor of 3.  Unlike a Huffman code, 
which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses
only fixed length (1-byte) op code and address 
fields.  The most frequent instructions consist of a
single 1-byte field.  As a consequence, instruction 
decoding time is minimized, and the machine is
efficient with respect to both space and time.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1362.html</h3><br/><p>	Information
Interchange (ASCII) contains a number  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  control 
characters associated with the principle of code extension,
that is, with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the Code.  The manner of use of these 
characters has not previously been completely described.
 This paper presents a set of mutually consistent 
philosophies regarding code extension applications,
and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the 
application of the code extension characters.  Distinctions
are drawn between code extension and such 
other concepts as "graphic substitution" or "syntactic
representation" which are often used to meet similar 
requirements.  Also covered are certain topics which
are not truly concerned with code extension but 
which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications.
 The material in this paper is equally 
applicable in principle to the (proposed) ISO international
7-bit code for information interchange.

In this communication the use  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  a shift-register
code with n = 10 is described for calling 
64 wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order.
 A high degree of redundancy is used, permitting 
a single-error correcting code ("minimum-distance-three"
code) with 64 10-bit code words to be employed 
as the station identification code.  Embedding this in
the shift-register code with period 1023 permits 
the code to be employed without punctuation, each of
the telemetering station receivers simply putting 
received ones and zeros into a shift register.  Each
time the given code combination arises identifying 
the particular station (barring for tuitous error combinations
of very low probability) it has been called. 
 The communication describes the properties and application
of the code in some detail and the finding 
of the particular example to be employed on URAL, the
Soviet-built drum computer donated to the Indian 
Statistical Institute by the United Nations
Technical Aid Administration (UNTAA).

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2233.html</h3><br/><p>	Jefferson Beale in 1822 have been the subject  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  
intensive study for over 100 years.  Generations of
cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus 
far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies
of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have 
devoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills
of Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. 
 The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,
yet serious students of cryptography have always 
had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity.
 It has been alleged that the "known solution" to 
Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...("I
have deposited in the County of Bedford about 
four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault...")
with the aid of an unsanitized version of the 
Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative,
and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago 
for whatever reasons.  Modern computer technology could
obviously perform signature analyses the process 
of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
insights into their construction.  For the benefit 
of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the
second cypher employs a specified document whose 
words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters
of these words are sought out at random to 
match the letters of these words are sought out at random
to match the letters of the clear text or message. 
 The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
is then written down as the final code.  While 
primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
security until the source document becomes known; 
at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
graders.  The work now completed with the help 
of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies
of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. 
 For example, we have turned the entire process of
simulated encoding by various schemes over to the 
machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic
codes; we have also encoded various messages by 
hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to
obtain their signatures. These simulations provide 
convincing evidence that the signatures are both process
and data dependent; they indicate also very 
strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that
it is merely a matter of time before someone 
finds the correct source document and locates the
right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.

A survey  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  machines which are more powerful
than finite automata and less powerful than general 
Turing machines is presented.  It is felt that the machines
in this category are as closely related to 
digital computers as either the finite automata or the
unrestricted Turing machines.  Intermediate machines 
can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memory
to a finite-state machine and then performing any 
or all of the following: (1) restrict the manner in
which the unbounded portion of the memory can be 
accessed, (2) bound the number of steps allowed for a
computation by some increasing recursive function 
of the length of the input, (3) restrict the total amount
of memory available in the same manner.  Examples 
from all three classes and their properties are discussed.

Machine Independence: Its Technology  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Economics

A survey is offered of techniques for transferring
programs, and especially compilers, from 
one computer to another.  Of the methods examined, the
"bootstrap" technique is singled out for detailed 
discussion, with emphasis on its economics. The considerations
that determine the applicability of bootstrapping 
in any specific case are discussed, and an attempt
is made to assign appropriate qualitative weights 
to them.  Finally, reasons are given for believing that the
machine-independence problem is being substantially 
diminished by current trends in computer design, and
that it is this process of convergence in hardware 
design rather than any foreseeable software developments
that will lead to its satisfactory resolution.

Operations on vectors, matrices,  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  higher dimensional storage arrays are 
standard features of most compilers today.  The elements of such structures are
usually restricted to be scalars.  For many sophisticated applications
this restriction can impose cumbersome data representations.
An efficient system has been devised and implemented which allows
the elements of multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensional
arrays.  This system was developed from a storage structure
in which the location, length, and content of each array is described
by a codeword which can be interpreted by the system.  Code words may describe 
arrays containing more codewords, thus providing
all needed descriptive information for hyperstructures of any form.

N-Dimensional Codes for Detecting  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Correcting Multiple Errors

The paper introduces a new family of codes
for detecting and correcting multiple errors in 
a binary-coded message.  The message itself is arranged
(conceptually) into a multidimensional rectangular 
array.  The processes of encoding and error detection
are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed 
dimensions of the array.  Effectiveness of the codes
is increased by introducing a "system check bit", 
which is essentially a parity check on the other parity
bits.  Only three-dimensional codes are discussed 
in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal,
the vertical, and one main diagonal.  However, 
the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions,
as evidenced by the discussion by Minnick 
and Ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit
selection plan used for another purpose [6]. 
 A four-dimensional code, correcting three and detecting
four errors, has been developed; the extension 
to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward.

This paper describes an experiment in program

processing professionals using seven methods to test
a small PL/I program.  The results show that the 
popular code walk through/inspection method was as effective
as other computer-based methods in finding 
errors and that the most effective methods (in terms of
errors found and cost) employed pairs of subjects 
who tested the program independently and then pooled
their findings.  The study also shows that there 
is a tremendous amount of variability among subjects
and that the ability to detect certain types of 
errors varies from method to method.

in terms of an example grammar which describes

Oregon State University has designed  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  constructed
a medium-speed serial digital computer 
using glass delay lines circulating at 22 Mc as memory.
 The design objectives as originally conceived 
in a special seminar were: (1) to be a research project
in computer design; (2) to be usable as an educational 
machine;and (3) to have easily modifiable hardware for
basic research in computer systems design.  An 
unusual arrangement of information within the 22 Mc
memory allows a simple interface with the 340 Kc 
arithmetic unit, which results in an effective zero latency
time and provides possibilities for an associative 
memory.  The arithmetic unit has a command structure similar
to large parallel machines, and uses flip-flop 
arithmetic and control registers throughout.  All hardware
development has been aimed toward the concept 
of easy modification, elaborate console controls for
effective man-machine interaction and low cost.

processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

of characters  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

As part of an effort to design  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  implement
a Fortran compiler on the ILLIAC IV, an extended 
Fortran, called IVTRAN, has been developed.  This language
provides a means of expressing data and control 
structures suitable for exploiting ILLIAC IV parallelism.
 This paper reviews the hardware characteristics 
of the ILLIAC and singles out unconventional features
which could be expected to influence language (and 
compiler) design.  The implications of these features for
data layout and algorithm structure are discussed, 
and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation rather than
code structuring is the crucial ILLIAC optimization 
problem.  A satisfactory method of data allocation is
then presented.  Language structures to utilize 
this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described.

as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove

incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors.  The algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time.  A realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted.  A procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time O(k log
n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k an arbitrary 
integer.  The model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location.

Two formal models for  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  computation
are presented: an abstract conceptual model and 
a parallel-program model.  The former model does not
distinguish between control and data states.  The 
latter model includes the capability for the representation
of an infinite set of control states by allowing 
there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or
processes) executing the program.  An induction 
principle is presented which treats the control and
data state sets on the same ground.  Through the 
use of "place variables," it is observed that certain
correctness conditions can be expressed without 
enumeration of the set of all possible control states.
 Examples are presented in which the induction 
principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion.
 It is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle.
A special case of the assertions method, which 
is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be
incomplete.  A formalization of "deadlock" is then 
presented. The concept of a "norm" is introduced, which
yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, 
of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
and permits shared global variables.  Correctness 
of certain forms of implementation is also discussed.
 An Appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.

We present a  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n).  An
O(log2n) time bound also can be achieved using only n$n/$log2n)) processors.
The algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure
of a symmetric Boolean matrix.  We assume that the processors have
access to a common memory.  Simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  processing algorithm for shrinking
binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, 
one for each pattern, is presented.  This procedure
may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and 
a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large
scale integrated technology is envisioned.  The 
principal features of this method are the very small
window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel 
nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking
any pattern, regardless of the complexity of 
its configuration.  Problems regarding merging and disconnection
of patterns during the process as well 
as the determination of the maximum number of steps
necessary to obtain a single isolated element from 
a pattern, are reviewed and discussed.  An analogy with a
neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts 
"neurons" is presented.

 Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in

sufficient conditions under which the list processor never

are shown to require at most twice as much processing
power as regular garbage collectors, if they are 
used efficiently.  The average behavior of the program
is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case 
performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also
suitable for measuring the typical behavior of

 This paper defines a more powerful deductive system which
is in some sense complete for partial correctness. 
 A crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,
which are added to a parallel program as 
an aid to proving it correct.  The information in a partial
correctness proof can be used to prove such 
properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock,
and program termination.  Techniques for verifying 
these properties are presented and illustrated by

processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

In this report three thinning  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  are
developed: one each for use with rectangular, 
hexagonal, and triangular arrays.  The approach to the
development of each algorithm is the same.  Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.  It is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive 
to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield
a thinned image with an overall reduced number of 
points.  It is concluded that the algorithm operating in
conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.

When proving that a  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i.e. that the statement
cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program. 
 Here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that
the assumption that a statement is indivisible 
can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as
halting.  Thus correctness proofs of a parallel 
system can often be greatly simplified.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1811.html</h3><br/><p>	question of whether it is possible to program 
 <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong> -processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when N processors are applied approaches
1/N times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing
memory and processor time requirements.  This 
observation is valid for configurations ranging from
a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to 
multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory.  If the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in

then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed.  A procedure is given which combines this
requirement with the earlier ordering considerations 
to provide an optimal execution sequence.

the generalized inverse with little extra effort

gives the generalized inverse for any m by

yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

carefully designed matrix  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  can lead to 
enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring
when only a small part of the total matrix can 
be in main memory at one time.  Examination of addition,
multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows 
that a partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrix
or partition per page) in most cases induced 
fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation.
 The number of page-pulls required by these matrix 
manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function
of the number of pages of main memory available 
to the algorithm.

n vertices, Hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5(n 
- 1)! specific permutations of n elements, termed rosary
permutations, can be defined.  Each of them 
corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image
each other, and is generated successively 
by a number system covering 3*4*...*(n-1) sets of edges.
 Every set of edges {E[k]}, 1 <= E[k] <= k, 
3 <= k <= (n-1) is determined recursively by constructing
a Hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from 
a Hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices, starting with
the Hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices.  The basic 
operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent
vertices where the position of the pair in 
the permutation is determined by {E[k]}.  Two algorithms
treating the same example for five vertices 
are presented.  It is very easy to derive all possible n!
permutations  from the .5(n - 1 )! rosary permutations 
be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the
reverse order-procedures which can be performed 
fairly efficiently by computer.

Given a pair of directed line  <strong style='color:blue;''>graph</strong> s, the problem
of ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic 
is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known.
 Since a straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years of running time on a very high
speed computer in order to compare two 15-node 
graphs, a more sophisticated approach seems called
for.  The situation is similar to that prevailing 
in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving, where
practical algorithms are unknown (for the interesting 
cases), but where various practical though only partially
successful techniques are available.  Git-Graph 
Isomorphism Tester-incorporates a variety of processes
that attempt to narrow down the search for an 
isomorphism, or to demonstrate that none exists.  No one
scheme is relied upon exclusively for a solution, 
and the program is designed to avoid excessive computation
along fruitless lines.  GIT has been written 
in the COMIT language and successfully tested on the IBM 7090.

Progressive Acyclic Di <strong style='color:blue;''>graph</strong> s-A Tool for Database Integrity

A progressive acyclic digraph (PAD) algorithm accepts are requests and
maintains a graph in an acyclic state.  When a request creates a cycle,
nodes are, "detached" until the new are can be entered acyclically
This process is important in certain areas of database implementation
in which there are constraints on the permissible sequences
of actions. Two PAD algorithms are presented; one uses a simple
path matrix representation and the other uses a list with an
"artificial gradient."  Experiments suggest that for large N the second
is considerably faster, though both are asymptotically O(NR),
where N is the number of nodes and R is the expected number
of nodes reachable along paths from any given node.

matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

Two  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  for generating computer programs
from decision tables are described.  The algorithms 
allow handling limited entry, extended entry, and mixed
entry tables.  The algorithms are based on the 
rule mask method but need not have the masks at execution
time.  They perform the logical operations 
immediately rather than at the end of the interpreting
process.  Execution time can be considerably reduced 
by instantly marking rules which are not applicable (Algorithms
1 and 2) or conditions which are already 
tested (Algorithm 2).  The new algorithms combine to a
certain degree the advantages of mask methods with 
those of tree methods.

Welch's algorithm is superior.  Timing estimates

 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to

a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

S <strong style='color:blue;''>to</strong> ring a Sparse Table

The problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in 
computer science.  The standard technique for storing such tables is
hashing, but hashing has poor worst-case performance.  We propose
a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries,
each an integer between 0 and N - 1.  The method requires 0(n) w
words of storage and allows O(logn N) access time.  Although our method
is a little complicated to use in practice, our analysis shows
why a simpler algorithm used for compressing LR parsing tables works so well.

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>computational</strong>  method which may be used for
the calculation of sums of squares in the analysis 
of variance of complete factorial experiments and in
the computation of main effect or interaction means 
is described.  The method is elucidated as unifying since
one method can be used for a variety of purposes 
each previously requiring different methods.  The programming
advantages of such a method are obvious. 
 The following variants are discussed: (1) the standard
analysis of variance; (2) analyses omitting certain 
levels of one or more factors; (3) separate analyses
for some levels of a factor or for combinations 
of levels of more than one factor.  These are performed
simultaneously; (4) the calculation of main effect 
or interaction means.  The mean expects the data in standard
order and it leaves the data in that order 
so that many analyses of the same data can be performed
without rearrangement.  The total sum of squares, 
excluding a replication sum of squares, is partitioned
into all polynomial partitions and their interactions 
each with one degree of freedom.  This is so even
if factors have unequally spaced factor levels.

In this paper trade-offs among certain  <strong style='color:blue;''>computational</strong>  factors
a given set of messages.  Two new hash-coding methods are examined
and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method.
The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area
(space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the 
given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  The new methods 
are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded 
information from that associated with conventional methods.  The reduction in 
space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident
hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

results have shown that deletion in such a structure can
also be performed in O(log n) time.  Thus the result of this paper
gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should
be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time 
complexity than insertion.  Furthermore, it can now be concluded
that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can
be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for
the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor.  However,
the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much
more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees.

of an environment is greatly increased while 
the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within
a fixed upper limit.  Second, a meaningful way 
is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in
a scene.  Third, "clipping" becomes a very fast 
logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment
within the field of view.  Fourth, frame 
to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure 
that should be present in primary store for immediate
access by the visible surface algorithm.  Finally, 
the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,
visible surface algorithm in which the computation 
time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

in the array.  The chief  <strong style='color:blue;''>computational</strong>  advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

through the developments in  <strong style='color:blue;''>complexity</strong>  theory. 
 These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such

The Programmer's Workbench-A Mach <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ne for Software Development

On almost all software development projects the
assumption is made that the program development 
function will be done on the same machine on which the
eventual system will run.  It is only when this 
production machine is unavailable or when its programming
environment is totally inadequate that alternatives 
are considered.  In this paper it is suggested that
there are many other situations where it would be 
advantageous to separate the program development and
main tenance function onto a specialized computer 
which is dedicated to that purpose.  Such a computer
is here called a Programmer's Workbench.  The four 
basic sections of the paper in troduce the subject,outline
the general concept, discuss areas where such 
an approach may prove beneficial, and describe
an operational system utilizing this concept.

of quadric surfaces. A parameterization scheme is used.
 Each quadric surface intersection curve (QSIC) 
is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter
limits.  Each value of the parameter represents 
at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished.
 This scheme can find the coordinates of points 
of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, using
equations of no more than second order.  Methods 
of parameterization for each type of OSIC are discussed,
as well as surface bounding and hidden surface

Computer Photocompos <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> tion of Technical Text

In computer assisted typesetting by means of
photocomposition, special problems arise in highly 
technical material such as mathematical formulas.  New
solutions to several of these problems have been 
devised in the information system of the American Institute
of Physics.  They include: the representation 
of special characters (foreign alphabets, mathematical
symbols, etc.) not available on input keyboards 
or on the photocomposer; the generation of such symbols,
e.g. by overprinting; the precise positioning 
of accent marks (floating diacritics); line breaks,
i.e. words or formulas placed partly at the end of 
one line and partly at the beginning of the next;
and certain aspects of error correction.

Des <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> gning Surfaces in 3-D

An experimental system for computer-aided
design of free-form surfaces in three dimensions 
is described. The surfaces are represented in the system
as parametric basis splines. The principal features 
of the system are: (1) the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric
line drawings on a head-mounted display, 
and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional
"wand," which allows 3-D movements of the points 
controlling the shapes of the surfaces, (2) all of the
interactions with the surfaces are in real-time, 
and (3) the mathematical formulations used assume no
knowledge of them by the user of the system.  Also 
examined are some of the features that should be part
of a practical 3-D system for designing space-forms.

program preparation and assembly.  It focuses on the preparation and editing 
of continuously displayed 23,040-character text strings (manuscripts) which
can be positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding
and deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll.
Other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can 
be augmented by the user.  The machine, although small,
aids program design by providing display scope and premarked
randomly addressable LINC tapes as standard items, in an environment
similar to that of a sophisticated terminal.  The tapes are logically 
similar to a disk.  Priority was given to the design of efficient
tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory.  Techniques 
developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered system 
structure are outlined.  LAP6 is used by about 2000 people in 11 countries.  
Its design was strongly influenced by performance criteria established in 
interviews held with LINC users themselves during the specification period.

Hough has proposed an interesting and computationally
efficient procedure for detecting lines 
in pictures.  This paper points out that the use of angle-radius
rather than slope-intercept parameters 
simplifies the computation further.  It also shows
how the method can be used for more general curve 
fitting, and gives alternative interpretations
that explain the source of its efficiency.

H <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> erarchical Geometric Models for Visible Surface Algorithms

The geometric structure inherent in the definition
of the shapes of three-dimensional objects 
and environments is used not just to define their relative
motion and placement, but also to assist in 
solving many other problems of systems for producing
pictures by computer.  By using an extension of 
traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy,
five significant improvements to current 
techniques are possible.  First, the range of complexity
of an environment is greatly increased while 
the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within
a fixed upper limit.  Second, a meaningful way 
is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in
a scene.  Third, "clipping" becomes a very fast 
logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment
within the field of view.  Fourth, frame 
to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure 
that should be present in primary store for immediate
access by the visible surface algorithm.  Finally, 
the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,
visible surface algorithm in which the computation 
time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

A representation for polygons and polygonal

sides to be collectively examined.  The set of sides are
arranged in a binary tree hierarchy by inclusion. 
 A fast algorithm for testing the inclusion of a poin t
in a many-sided polygon is given.  The speed of 
the algorithm is discussed for both ideal and practical
examples.  It is shown that the poin ts of intersection 
of two polygonal lines can be located by what is essentially
a binary tree search.  The algorithm and

overcomes many of the disadvantages associated 
with the various fixed-grid methods for representing curves and regions

The Synthes <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> s of Solids Bounded by Many Faces

A technique is presented which allows a class
of solid objects to be synthesized and stored 
using a computer.  Synthesis begins with primitive solids
like a cube, wedge, or cylinder.  Any solid 
can be moved, scaled, or rotated.  Solids may also be
added together or subtracted.  Two algorithms to 
perform addition are described.  For practical designers,
the technique has the advantage that operations 
are concise, readily composed, and are given in terms
of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences 
of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.

Interference Detect <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> on Among Solids and Surfaces

In many industrial environments it is necessary to determine whether
r there is interference among components.  There are many potential
interference problems in products made up of assemblies of components 
and in product manufacturing and testing.  Typically, drawings
are used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences,
but the two-dimensional, static drafting medium does not always show
interferences among three-dimensional, moving parts.  This paper
 presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms
which carry out interference checking among objects so represented.  
Objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar
surfaces.  Two types of interference checking are discussed:
detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detection
of collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories.

SEMBEGS  <strong style='color:blue;''>is a</strong>  complete batch environment graphical
system containing components for handling 
graphical data files, for displaying the contents of
these files on a variety of graphical hardware, 
and for performing graphical batch input operations.
 SEMBEGS is easy to extend and modify to meet the 
growing needs of a large batch environment, and is even
extendable to a fully interactive system.  The 
paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading
to the design of SEMBEGS and outlines the major 
components of the system.  The design of SEMBEGS is founded
upon the basic assumption that the true aim 
of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities,
rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical 
input and output functional capabilities.  SEMBEGS
is built around a Basic Graphical Data Management 
System (BAGDAMS) which provides a common means of communicating
the descriptions of graphical entities 
 between the various components of SEMBEGS.  BAGDAMS
provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and 
manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities
provided by, and received by application programs,
graphics packages, and graphical devices.

Computers and Soc <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ety: A Proposed Course for Computer Scientists

The purpose of this paper is to describe a course
concerned with both the effects of computers 
on society and the responsibilities of computer scientists
to society.  The impact of computers is divided 
into five components: political, economic, cultural, social,
and moral; the main part of the paper defines 
each component and presents examples of the relevant
issues.  In the remaining portions the possible 
formats for such a course are discussed, a topic by topic
outline is given, and a selected set of references 
is listed.  It is hoped that the proposal will make
it easier to initiate courses on this subject.

A Scan Convers <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> on Algorithm with Reduced Storage Requirements

Most graphics systems using a raster scan output
device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display 
file in the XY or random scan format.  Scan converters,
hardware or software, must be provided to translate 
the picture description from the XY format to the raster
format.  Published scan conversion algorithms 
which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough
to accommodate the entire screen.  On the other 
hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because
they require multiple passes through the XY 
display file.  The scan conversion algorithm described
here uses a linked list data structure to process 
the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to
groups of scan lines.  A relatively small primary 
memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image
for a group of scan lines.  When this portion 
of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for
the next portion.  Because of the list processing 
procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display
file is required when generating the binary 
image and only a slight increase in execution time over
the fully buffered core results.  Results slow 
that storage requirements can be reduced by more than
80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent 
increase in execution time.

A System for Typesett <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ng Mathematics

This paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 The language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  Experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  For typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  For example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  The syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  Output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  The system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

 The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  The intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  The patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 The amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  Several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

The Associative Processing of Line Drawings (APLD)
System utilizes a hardware associative memory

two-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts,
lines, rectangles, and triangles. The APLD functions
were duplicated on the TX-2 computer at M.'s 
Lincoln Laboratory under the LEAP Language and Data
Structure,  A comparison of the hardware approach 
with the software simulation illustrates the advantages
of the hardware associative memory in three areas: 
(1) processing speed, (2) storage requirements, and (3)
flexibility.  The major problem areas of hardware 
associative memory technology, namely input/output
and cost effectiveness, are also addressed.

A Buddy System Var <strong style='color:blue;''>i</strong> ation for Disk Storage Allocation

A generalization of the buddy system for storage
allocation is described. The set of permitted 
block sizes {SIZE(i)}, i=0,n, must satisfy the condition
SIZE(i)=SIZE(i-1)+SIZE(i-k(i)) where k may be 
any meaningful integral-valued function.  This makes it
possible to force logical storage blocks to coincide 
with physical storage blocks, such as tracks and cylinders.

been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort

gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) 
= n.  In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of A.  In the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

Network

In order for the nodes of a  <strong style='color:blue;''>distributed</strong>  computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot
Potato Heuristic Routing Doctrine."  A correctness 
proof of this Topology Information Protocol is also presented.

therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms
discussed by Hoare, Singleton, and van Emden. 
 The solution to the integral equation indicates that
using more advanced algorithms in the family makes 
only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,
but substantially reduces the variance in sorting 
effort.  Statistical tests of the values of several
thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have 
given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution
function in satisfactory agreement with 
the moments computed from the generating function.  The
empirical tests, as well as the analytical results, 
are in agreement with previously published results for the
first moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform 
distribution of branching ratio, and for the second moment
in the case of uniform distribution of branching 
ratio.

 An algorithm for this problem is presented

is the total number of ordered pairs of positions

Algorithms for  <strong style='color:blue;''>computing</strong>  the resultant of two
polynomials in several variables, a key repetitive 
step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
equations by elimination, are studied.  Determining 
the best algorithm for computer implementation depends
upon the extent to which extraneous factors are 
introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by
truncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, 
and computing speed.  Preliminary considerations narrow
the choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's 
determinant and Collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence
(p.r.s.) algorithm.  Detailed tests performed 
on sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant
is superior in all respects except for 
univariate polynomials, in which case Collins' reduced
p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.  In particular 
Bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior in
numerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability 
with regard to round-off errors. Results of tests are reported in detail.

Computing St <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong> ard Deviations: Accuracy

Four algorithms for the numerical computation
of the standard deviation of (unweighted) sampled data
are analyzed.  Two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical
and computational literature; the other two are new algorithms
specifically intended for automatic computation.  Our discussion is 
expository, with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of
"accuracy."  Each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions
under which it will be accurate.  We conclude that all four
algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two
of the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate
on difficult problems than are the other two.

concluded that while, for certain values of system

Dijkstra, Knuth, and others.  Solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure
calls and guarded regions.  This concept 
is proposed for real-time applications controlled by

 The paper gives several examples of distributed processes
and shows that they include procedures, coroutines, 
classes, monitors, processes, semaphores, buffers, path

of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  Furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

Synchronization of concurrent  <strong style='color:blue;''>processes</strong>  requires controlling the relative 
ordering of events in the processes.
A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using 
abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes
to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual
exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control
ordering of events.  Direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed
systems.  The mechanism is defined formally, and then several
examples of its use are given.  The relationship of the mechanism
to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,
eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement
of information matters.  An implementation of eventcount
s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.

in the other direction for the more  <strong style='color:blue;''>applied</strong>  parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

A simple  <strong style='color:blue;''>stochastic</strong>  model is described which
offers a base for understanding the relationship 
between the number of programs permitted to share memory
(the degree of multiprogramming), drum traffic 
rates, and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand,
multiprogrammed, time-shared computer 
systems.  The model preserves, as a key feature, the
property of page-demand statistics which implies 
a "burst" of page demands at the beginning of any job
or quantum execution.  The model, a Markov chain, 
is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphically
for a wide range of key environment-descriptive 
parameters.  Implications of the results to time-shared
system design and programming are discussed, 
and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming
for a wide range of parameters is presented 
graphically.

 An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems.  The technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found.  In some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending 
the information available to the solution technique, but
in many cases the technique becomes computationally

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-3028.html</h3><br/><p>	Atlas: A His torical Perspective

In 30 years  <strong style='color:blue;''>of computer</strong>  design at Manchester University
two systems stand out: the Mark I (developed 
over the period 1946-49) and the Atlas (1955-62). 
This paper places each computer in its his torical 
context and then describes the architecture and system
software in present-day terminology.  Several 
design concepts such as address-generation and store
management have evolved in the progression from 
Mark I to Atlas.  The wider impact of Manchester innovations
in these and other areas is discussed, and 
the contemporary performance of the Mark I and Atlas is evaluated.

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>evaluation</strong> , by the propagation of variance
technique, of the sensitivity of time-varying 
systems to initial condition and parameter errors, involves
the determination of several system-dependent 
partial derivative matrices.  This requirement has led to
separate programs for each system under investigation. 
 A new program, through utilization of the Wengert differentiation
technique, automatically determines 
the required matrices from specific system equations supplied
in subroutine form at execution time, eliminating 
the need for individualized programs, and presaging the
further development of extremely general computer 
programs.

 This system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  The source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  Using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling 
of input-output activity.  Attention is given to the
amount of memory resource required for effective 
processing of the I/O activity (buffer space assignment).
 The model studies used both distribution-driven 
and trace-driven techniques.  Even relatively simple dynamic
schedulers are shown to improve system performance 
(as measured by user CPU time) over that given by optimal
or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded 
in identical system structures and workload environments.
 The improvement is greatest under a heavy

in order to explain the implementation of 
the DCF.  Events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 Events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 The time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  The overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  Several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  Some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.

with associated grammatical structure, to test the effect
of applying rules to the data, and to store 
both the definitions and results.  The rule application
facility described in detail was implemented 
by translating linguistic rules to rules in FLIP, a
format-directed list processor embedded in LISP. 
 This made the system construction easy while providing
sophisticated capabilities for the linguist. 
 The system is written in BBN LISP on the Scientific
Data System 940 computer and is designed to be used 
on-line in interactive fashion, with control returned
to the user after each command is executed.

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>performance</strong>  of information retrieval systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

a mode  <strong style='color:blue;''>of computer</strong>  operation in which two or more
programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,

are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, 
according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.
 It is useful to be able to represent them 
as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each
at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other
programs.  The effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents and simulation has 
been the best available method of predicting it.  This
paper presents the results of progress in developing 
an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
computation of these rates under certain 
situations.  The algorithm is sensitive to most of the
factors that control the phenomenon, including 
nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.

for  <strong style='color:blue;''>performance evaluation</strong>  of alternative 
configurations of highly concurrent computers.  A technique
is described for constructing a detailed 
deterministic simulation model of a system.  In the model
a control stream replaces the instruction and 
data streams of the real system.  Simulation of the
system model yields the timing and resource usage 
statistics needed for performance evaluation, without
the necessity of emulating the system.  As a case 
study, the implementation of a simulator of a model
of the CPU-memory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is 
described.  The results of evaluating some alternative
system designs are discussed.  The experiments 
reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecks
in the system are the memory unit and the fixed 
point unit.  Further, it appears that many of the sophisticated
pipelining and buffering technique simplemented 
in the architecture of the IBM 360/91 are of little
value when high-speed (cache) memory is used, as 
in the IBM 360/195.

of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1267.html</h3><br/><p>	Information thruput as a characteristic of
systems  <strong style='color:blue;''>performance</strong>  is discussed.  This discussion 
includes the pertinent aspects of information transfer,
of determination of transfer rate of information 
bits (TRIB), of residual errors, and of standard measurement
conditions.  The paper also presents an 
orderly arrangement of characteristics and parameters
that affect information thruput, and some examples 
on procedures for determining a thruput rate in terms of
TRIB.  It concludes that a performance characteristic 
involving information rate can best be expressed as the
TRIB in conjunction with the Residual Error Rate.

technique which can ease this problem is macroscopic simulation.
 This paper reports on the applicability 
of that technique to System/360.  The paper describes
an experimental model of System/360-its hardware, 
software, and its environment.  The measures of system performance
produced by the model consist of statistics 
relating to turnaround time, throughput, hardware utilization,
software utilization, and queueing processes. 
 The model is mechanized in SIMSCRIPT and consists of
some 1750 statements.  An auxiliary programs, the

This paper investigates  <strong style='color:blue;''>mechanisms</strong>  that guarantee
secure information flow in a computer system. 
These mechanisms are examined within a mathematical framework
suitable for formulating the requirements 
of secure information flow among security classes. The
central component of the model is a lattice structure 
derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics
of information flow.  The lattice properties 
permit concise formulations of the security requirements
of different existing systems and facilitate 
the construction of mechanisms that enforce security.
 The model provides a unifying view of all systems 
that restrict information flow, enables a classification
of them according to security objectives, and 
suggests some new approaches.  It also leads to the construction
of automatic program certification mechanisms 
for verifying the secure flow of information through a program.

DAD, The C. Operat <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g System

The design and implementation of the C.
operating system, DAD, is described in detail. 
 This system is designed for the Control Data 3600 using
a large drum backing store and is intended to 
allow the integration of a remote console (display) subsystem
into a conventional job stack environment. 
 The use of the drums, the buffering of input and output
on slow peripherals, and the execution of normal 
job stack work are described.  The display subsystem
is described only as it integrates into the rest 
of the system.  The techniques found useful in the development
of DAD are given, and an assessment is 
made of the validity of various design decisions.  Performance
figures based on several months of operation 
are tabulated.

A model of protection  <strong style='color:blue;''>mechanisms in</strong>  computing
systems is presented and its appropriateness 
is argued.  The "safety" problem for protection systems
under this model is to determine in a given situation 
whether a subject can acquire a particular right to
an object.   In restricted cases, it can be shown 
that this problem is decidable, i.e. there is an algorithm
to determine whether a system in a particular 
configuration is safe.  In general, and under surprisingly
weak assumptions, it cannot be decided if 
a situation is safe. Various implications of this fact are discussed.

 Moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problems
of handling material such as off line encrypted 
data or non-ASCII codes by means of systems providing
complete character transparency.  It does not cover 
concepts of transparency in which the normal character
structure or modulation rate of a system may be 
abandoned.  In conjunction with the earlier tutorial
paper, this paper is expected to lead to a proposal 
for stand ardizationof data communication control procedures
using the American Stand ard Code for Information

 Five design principles help provide insight into the
tradeoffs among different possible designs.  The 
key mechanisms described include access control lists,

is described.  The model transferred  <strong style='color:blue;''>control</strong>  to the
operating system to execute functions other than 
teaching, and then recovered control in order to resume
teaching.  The teaching system (ABAC-II) was 
written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for
the IBM 7044 Graphic System.  Because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode.  During the latter, the 
full resources of the operating system (language processors,
compilers, library and user's programs) 
were at his disposal.  He could for example, write, assemble,
debug, and execute at the terminal a program 
written in any language processed by the operating system.
 A course could therefore include text material 
interleaved with programming problems which the student
could solve without leaving the terminal.  Exercises 
in simulation and gaming could also be provided.  The
implications of a teaching system with this degree 
of flexibility for industrial and executive training
as well as academic education are discussed.  In 
addition, the advantages of this type of system for computer
programming and operation are also considered.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>in operating systems</strong>  by access control mechanisms.  This
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  The extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

managed multilevel  <strong style='color:blue;''>memory</strong>  system requires 
a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the
information stored in the memory.  Some recent 
experimental measurements on the Multics virtual memory
suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably 
simple program reference model will suffice.  The simple
model combines the effect of the information 
reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management
algorithm to produce a single, composite 
statement: the mean number of memory references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the 
size of the paging memory.  The resulting model is easy
to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse 
problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,
arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, 
and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.

in the computer.    All  <strong style='color:blue;''>aspects of</strong>  the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  The scheme is based
on using a function H which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  This function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  The intruder may know all about H and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert H to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  This paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable H.  Two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  Finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

the available  <strong style='color:blue;''>memory</strong>  is discussed.  Measurements 
by Brown et al. and by Nelson on an automatic folding
mechanism of simple design, a demand paging unit 
built at the IBM Research Center by Belady, Nelson,
O'Neil, and others, permitting its quality to be 
compared with that of manual folding, are discussed,
and it is shown that given some care in use the 
unit performs satisfactorily under the conditions tested,
even though it is operating across a memory-to-storage 
interface with a very large speed difference.  The disadvantages
of prefolding, which is required when 
the folding is manual, are examined, and a number of
the important troubles which beset computing today 
are shown to arise from, or be aggravated by, this
source.  It is concluded that a folding mechanism 
will probably become a normal part of most computing systems.

 It is based on the concept of critical working set, a
working set which does not contain the next memory 
reference.  The data the method operates upon are extracted from
a trace of the program to be restructured. 
 It is shown that, except in some special cases, the
method is not optimum.  However, the experimental 
results obtained by using the method to restructure an
interactive text editor and the file system module 
of an operating system have shown its substantial superiority
over the other methods proposed in the 
literature.

systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  Interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

System utilizes a hardware associative  <strong style='color:blue;''>memory</strong>

two-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts,

were duplicated on the TX-2 computer at M.'s 
Lincoln Laboratory under the LEAP Language and Data
Structure,  A comparison of the hardware approach 
with the software simulation illustrates the advantages
of the hardware associative memory in three areas: 
(1) processing speed, (2) storage requirements, and (3)
flexibility.  The major problem areas of hardware 
associative memory technology, namely input/output
and cost effectiveness, are also addressed.

A model of interleaved  <strong style='color:blue;''>memory</strong>  systems is presented,
and the analysis of the model by Monte 
Carlo simulation is discussed.  The simulations investigate
the performance of various system structures, 
i.e. schemes for sending instruction and data requests
to the memory system.  Performance is measured 
by determining the distribution of the number of memory
modules in operation during a memory cycle.  
An important observation from these investigations is that
separately grouping instruction and data requests 
for memory can substantially increase the average number
of memory modules in operation during a memory 
cycle.  Results of the simulations and an analytical
study are displayed for various system structures.

A virtual  <strong style='color:blue;''>memory</strong>  computer system with a fast
buffer (cache) memory between primary memory and 
the central processing unit is considered.  The optimal
distribution of a program between the buffer 
and primary memory is studied using the program's lifetime
function.  Expressions for the distribution 
of a program which maximizes the useful fraction of
the cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer 
storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies.

Traditional concepts of  <strong style='color:blue;''>management</strong>  information
systems (MIS) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most US local
governments.  What exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  Despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  Management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  Finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly
involving improvements in decision information.

The characteristics of the virtual  <strong style='color:blue;''>memory</strong>  requirements
of a sample of Algol 60 programs have 
been measured.  Distributions are presented for thesizes
of memory requests and for their holding times 
(lifetimes).  The results are presented in terms of Johnston's
contour model and a simple abstract machine. 
 They provide new empirical evidence of certain aspects
of the construction and behavior of real programs, 
and some of their implications for the design of virtual

Optimal Program and Data Locati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> s in Computer Networks

An optimization procedure for the allocation
of program and data files in a computer network 
is presented.  This algorithm takes into account the
dependencies between files and programs such as 
occur in real heterogeneous computer networks.  Insights
into whether or not to convert programs from 
one computer to another can also be gained from the
model.  A search procedure for the file location 
problem is described, along with an example
and a possible application of the model.

 An example of one such problem is PERT.  The present
paper presents a very general method for obtaining 
topological order.  It permits treatment of larger networks
than can be handled on present procedures 
and achieves this with greater efficiency.  Although
the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it 
is discussed in terms of the 7090.  A PERT network of
30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one 
hour of machine time.  The method was developed as
a byproduct of procedures needed by Westinghouse, 
Baltimore.  It has not been programmed and at present
there are no plans to implement it.  In regard 
to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present
and anticipated needs are completely served by the 
Lockheed program, which is in current use.

Schedule Problem" takes various forms  <strong style='color:blue;''>in the</strong>

in the terminology of classical Network Theory. 
 One such formulation is:  Given a nondirected network,
partition its nodes into a minimal number of 
subsets such that no two members of the same subset
are connected by anarc.  An obvious lower limit 
to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected
subgraph.  Kirchgassner proved that an upper 
limit is this size plus one.  One logical extension of
the previous work is the introduction of variable 
length examinations where W(I) is the number of periods
for exam I.  The object of this paper is to generalize 
the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph
to include the weighting of nodes, to present an 
approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest
strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the 
application of this algorithm to the solution of
school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.

that a modification of the adaptive algorithm

This paper describes a system for full-duplex
communication between a time-shared computer 
and its terminals.  The system consists of a communications
computer directly connected to the time-shared 
system, a number of small remote computers to which
the terminals are attached, and connecting medium 
speed telephone lines.  It can service a large number
of terminals of various types.  The overall system 
design is presented along with the algorithms used to
solve three specific problems: local echoing, error 
detection and correction on the telephone lines,
and multiplexing of character output.

The file allocation problem-i.e. the problem
of finding the optimal set of network sites at 
which to locate copies of a file-is known to be, in general,
polynomial complete.  Heuristics and other 
aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal, solutions are
therefore much needed.  In this paper we present 
three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate
that certain sites should (or should not) be 
included in an optimal allocation.

 An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems.  The technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found.  In some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending 
the information available to the solution technique, but
in many cases the technique becomes computationally

A Study of Line Overhead  <strong style='color:blue;''>in the</strong>  Arpanet

The form, extent, and effect of the communication line
overhead in the ARPANET are considered. 
 The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.  Then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied. 
 Some measurements of line efficiency for the ARPANET are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements 
are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network.
Similar results are derived for a recently 
proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2402.html</h3><br/><p>	computers encourages the development of  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong> 
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

sorting procedure are examinedhe optimum 
algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unit
strings read is displayed.  The logic of this 
algorithm is rather complicated; hence, several other
new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward 
logic are presented.  Of the simple dispersion algorithms
discussed, the  Horizontal is best.  It does 
approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percent
less reading and writing than most algorithms in 
use today.  An additional two and one-fourth to three
percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing 
the Modified Optimum Algorithm.  This algorithm is relatively
straightforward, but it requires a fairly 
close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins.

that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.  It is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive

a thinned image with an overall reduced number of

conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.

A Stochastic Evaluati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  Model for Database
Organization in Data Retrieval Systems

Experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost. This paper
discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval 
system which has the effect of significantly reducing
the cost of experimentation and enabling research 
never attempted before.  The model is designed to estimate
the retrieval workload of alternative data 
retrieval systems.  These data retrieval systems can
be organized under several database organizations, 
including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems.  Effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems.  In particular,
the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

Arguments for a Moratorium  <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  the Construction
of a Community Information Utility

In this article the author urges a prudent
and decentralized approach to the question of the 
design and desirability of computerized community information
utilities.  Before accepting the inevitability 
and desirability of this or any technology, we should:
(1) be sure of the feasibility (internally and 
externally) of what is proposed; (2) project and perhaps
wait for changes in complementary techniques; 
(3) evaluate current and projected supplementary techniques;
(4) establish the existence of demand for 
what is proposed; (5) take steps to involve a representative
group of ultimate users in systems design, 
and (6) carefully think through possible side effects
on man and his world view.  Current proposals for 
community information utilities are examined in this
framework, and the conclusion is drawn that society 
is not yet in a position to justify either the construction
of an information utility in a prototype 
community or the acceptance of a policy in
favor of its widespread implementation.

to a line of code, (3) chunks are frequently occurring

behavior can be characterized in terms of its 
residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes,
and the transitions between these localities. 
 In this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicit
through a formal definition of what constitutes 
a phase of localized reference behavior, and by a corresponding
mechanism for the detection of localities 
in actual reference strings.  This definition provides
for the existence of a hierarchy of localities 
at any given time, and the reasonableness of the definition
is supported by examples taken from actual 
programs.  Empirical data from a sample of production
Algol 60 programs is used to display distributions 
of locality sizes and lifetimes, and these results are
discussed in terms of their implications for the 
modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems.

Educational technology is currently quite

aspects of technology, changes possible in the next generation
or two are now known as ideas, discoveries

will become the actual and, if so, on what time 
scale.  This ignorance stems largely from ignorance about
the social response to potential technological 
change.  The object of this paper is to present a vision

Answering English questi <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> s by Computer: A Survey

Fifteen experimental English language question-answering
systems which are programmed and operating 
are described and reviewed.  The systems range from a conversation
machine to programs which make sentences 
about pictures and systems which translate from English
into logical calculi.  Systems are classified 
as list-structured data-based, graphic data-based, text-based
and inferential.  Principles and methods 
of operations are detailed and discussed.  It is concluded
that the data-base question-answer has passed 
from initial research into the early developmental
phase.  The most difficult and important research 
questions for the advancement of general-purpose language
processors are seen to be concerned with measuring, 
dealing with ambiguities, translating into formal
languages and searching large tree structures.

of every programming language: (1) the elementary 
program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary
statements together, (3) the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs.  Several alternative
forms of each of these components are described, 
compared and evaluated.  Many examples, frequently from
list processing languages, illustrate the forms 
described.  Elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands, requirements, or implicit 
specifications.  A command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken.  A requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken.  An implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  An execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  Names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language.   He concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs, organizing systems, and referencing 
data.

Recursi <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  Analysis for Compiler Optimization

A relatively simple method for the detection
of recursive use of procedures is presented for 
use in compiler optimization.  Implementation considerations
are discussed, and a modification of the 
algorithm is given to further improve optimization.
 This analysis can also be used to determine what 
possible subset of values could be assumed by variables
which can only take on a relatively small discrete 
set of values.  The most common are parameters of variables
assuming values of label, procedure, or Pascal's 
enumerated type.

Representati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  of Many-Sided Polygons
and Polygonal Lines for Rapid Processing

A representation for polygons and polygonal
lines is described which allows sets of consecutive 
sides to be collectively examined.  The set of sides are
arranged in a binary tree hierarchy by inclusion. 
 A fast algorithm for testing the inclusion of a poin t
in a many-sided polygon is given.  The speed of 
the algorithm is discussed for both ideal and practical
examples.  It is shown that the poin ts of intersection 
of two polygonal lines can be located by what is essentially
a binary tree search.  The algorithm and 
a practical example are discussed.  The representation
overcomes many of the disadvantages associated 
with the various fixed-grid methods for representing curves and regions

features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made

framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  Three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  Interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed

programs are incomplete in that intermediate 
inductive assertions must be provided manually by the
user, termination is not proven, and incorrect

these problems, this paper suggests conducting a 
logical analysis of programs by using invariants which
express what is actually occurring in the program. 
 The first part of the paper is devoted to techniques
for the automatic generation of invariants.  The 
second part provides criteria for using the invariants
to check simultaneously for correctness (including 
termination) or incorrectness.  A third part examines
the implications of the approach for the automatic 
diagnosis and correction of logical errors.

manipulations to be performed in automatic information
systems are first briefly reviewed.  A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.  Advantages of these programming languages

An Informati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> -Theoretic Approach to
Text Searching in Direct Access Systems

Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome 
one of the problems often associated with information
retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large 
dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only
infrequently.  A novel method is presented, which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.  This is
more suited to implementation on storage devices. 
 This method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
The rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

Plankalkul was an attempt by Korrad Zuse in
the 1940's to devise a notational and conceptual 
system for writing what today is termed a program.  Although
this early approach to a programming language 
did not lead to practical use, the plan is described
here because it contains features that are standard 
in today's programming languages.  The investigation
is of historical interest; also, it may provide 
insights that would lead to advancements in the state

the Plankalkul is presented to the extent it has possible
to reconstruct it from the published literature.

 This freedom simplified both incremental compilation

new concept for operating systems: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource

in queueing network models of computer systems. 
 Empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applying
this methodology to an actual multiaccess

variables such as memory requirement distribution 
and job swap time, and performance measures such as response
time and memory utilization are graphically 
displayed. A multiphase, analytically soluble model is
proposed as being broadly applicable to the analysis

C <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> sumer Difficulties With Computerized Transactions: 
An Empirical Investigation

The prevalence with which errors may be encountered by the 
end targets of a computerized process is assessed.  How many and
what type of errors occur?  How easily are they corrected?  What
is the reaction of consumers to errors-to a failure to correct
them?  What can be learned by designers of large management packages
from such data? Results show that with the present state of the
art, approximately 40 percent of individuals (or households) having
average contacts with different types of accounts experience one
or more errors per year.  Eighty percent relate to billing.  Attempts
to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always
successful. There appears to be some conflict between computer-using
organizations and their public.  Also the role of poor man
agement packages including poor software is indicated.  While most
management systems may be adequate, results of the survey raise
concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very
large linked program packages (as EFT for instance).

The method described assumes that a word
which cannot be found in a dictionary has at most 
one error, which might be a wrong, missing or extra letter
or a single transposition.  The unidentified 
input word is compared to the dictionary again, testing
each time to see if the words match-assuming 
one of these errors occurred.  During a test run on garbled
text, correct identifications were made for 
over 95 percent of these error types.

Intenti <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> al Resolution of Privacy Protection in Database Systems

Traditionally, privacy protection in database
systems is understood to be the control over 
what information a given user can get from a database.
 This paper is concerned with another, independent, 
dimension of privacy protection, the control over what
a user is allowed to do with a piece of information 
supplied to him by the database.  The ability to condition
the supply of information on its intended 
use is called here "intentional resolution" of privacy
protection.  The practical importance of intentional 
resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization
is discussed.  It is shown that intentional 
resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radical
change from the traditional approach to the 
process of user-database interaction.  In particular,
it appears to be necessary for the database to 
impose a certain amount of control over the internal
behavior of users' programs which interact with 
it.  A model for user-database interaction
which admits such a control is developed.

Comparis <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  of Their Values in a Problem - 
Solving Situation

An experimental comparison of problem-solving
using time-sharing and batch-processing computer 
systems conducted at MIT is described in this paper.
 This study is the first known attempt to evaluate 
two such systems for what may well be the predominant user
population within the next decade-the professionals 
who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an
aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather 
than as a programming end in itself.  Statistically
and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  There are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  The users' speed of problem-solving and their
attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable 
system.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2931.html</h3><br/><p>	and Programming Languages

Logic has been l <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> g in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  More recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

Management Utilizati <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong>  of Computers in American Local Governments

Traditional concepts of management information
systems (MIS) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most US local
governments.  What exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  Despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  Management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  Finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly
involving improvements in decision information.

Interactive Skele <strong style='color:blue;''>to</strong> n Techniques for Enhancing
Motion Dynamics in Key Frame Animation

A significant increase in the capability for
controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation 
is achieved through skeleton control.  This technique
allows an animator to develop a complex motion 
sequence by animating a stick figure representation
of an image.  This control sequence is then used 
to drive an image sequence through the same movement.
 The simplicity of the stick figure image encourages 
a high level of interaction during the design stage. 
Its compatibility with the basic key frame animation 
technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively
to only those components of a composite 
image sequence that require enhancement.

a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such

A method for extracting a smooth polygonal
contour from a digitized image is illustrated.
The ordered sequence of contour points and the connection graph of
the image are first obtained by a modified Ledley algorithm in one
image scan.  A minimal perimeter polygon subjected to specified constraints
is then chosen as the approximating contour.  The determination of the minimal 
polygon can be reduced to a nonlinear programming
problem, solved by an algorithm which takes into account
the weak bonds between variables.  Some examples are presented,
and the corresponding computing times are listed.

Using Synthetic Images  <strong style='color:blue;''>to</strong>  Register Real Images with Surface Models

A number of image analysis tasks can benefit
from registration of the image with a model of 
the surface being imaged.  Automatic navigation using visible
light or radar images requires exact alignment 
of such images with digital terrain models.  In addition,
automatic classification of terrain, using 
satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly
with the effects of varying sun angle and 
surface slope.  Even inspection techniques for certain
industrial parts may be improved by this means. 
We achieve the required alignment by matching the real
image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface 
model and known positions of the light sources.  The
synthetic image intensity is calculated using the 
reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection
as a function of surface gradient. 
 We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models.

and a computer language designed to facilitate 
symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been
devised whereby a digital computer can be used to 
do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation

techniques involved, a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass

 Since this operation involves a formulation in

it provides a good demonstration of a computer's 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the

 It also has many applications in numerical

algorithms are fairly complicated and require 
considerable storage space.  A simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort 
and with no additional storage requirements.  The algorithm
gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) 
= n.  In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of A.  In the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

A multistage decision process is then able to recognize

global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy 
in the particular problem is achieved.  The relation
between the structure of the figure of merit and 
the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.
 The method described is suitable for parallel 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in parallel, and the number
of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or
to log2 N if the approximate method is used).

The fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous
to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.
A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the
imaginary unit,  -1, followed by least squares addition of the column
(or row).  The elimination process for the procedure is successive
ssive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient)
form.  These ideas are illustrated with an implementation
of the revised simplex method.  The algorithm is a general purpose
one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity
in the equations.  Some suggested computational tests for determining
signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex
algorithm are mentioned.  A simple means of constructing
test cases and some sample computing times are presented.

matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from

Tr <strong style='color:blue;''>id</strong> iagonalization by Permutations

Tridiagonalizing a matrix by similarity transformations
is an important computational tool 
in numerical linear algebra. Consider the class of sparse
matrices which can be tridiagonalized using 
only row and corresponding column permutations.  The
advantages of using such a transformation include 
the absence of round-off errors and improved computation time
when compared with standard transformations. 
 A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary
n x n matrix and determines whether or not it 
can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given.  The
algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number 
of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number
of increments are linear in n.  This compares 
very favorably with standard transformation methods.
 If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, 
the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.
 Otherwise, early rejection will occur.

Given the adjacency matrix  <strong style='color:blue;''>of the</strong>  graph, the algorithm
presented in this paper finds a spanning 
tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles.
 Our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented 
by Welch by a ratio of N/3 (N is the number of nodes)
but requires less storage.  For graphs with a large 
number of nodes and edges, when storage is limited our
algorithm is superior to Welch's; however, when 
the graphs are small, or machine storage is very large,
Welch's algorithm is superior.  Timing estimates 
and storage requirements for both methods are presented.

proved that the diagonals  <strong style='color:blue;''>of the</strong>  LU decomposition 
converges when floating-point precision.  It is also
proved that the computed LU decomposition converges 
when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits
of the LU diagonals using floating point are 
roughly within machine precision of the limits using
real arithmetic.  This fact is exploited to reduce 
the number of floating-point operations required to
solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where 
k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.  If the
elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals 
are 1, then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed.  The
entire LU decomposition takes k words of storage, 
and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved.
 Upper and lower bounds on k are obtained 
in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal
constants and parameters of the floating-point 
number system.  Various generalizations of these results are discussed.

 It also has many applications in numerical

considerable storage space.  A simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort 
and with no additional storage requirements.  The algorithm
gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) 
= n.  In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of A.  In the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

A recently published method for the interpolative
solution of nonlinear equations is improved,
and applied to give a significant variation of the Goodman-Lance
method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems. 
The resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution
of optimal control problems in the Euler-Lagrange formulation.
Quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation
is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context.

Generation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Positive Test Matrices with Known Positive Spectra

Sufficient conditions are given for a real
matrix to be similar to a positive matrix.  This 
result is used to construct a similarity transformation
which, when applied to a particular upper triangular 
matrix, yields a positive matrix with a preassigned positive spectrum.

The stability  <strong style='color:blue;''>of the</strong>  Gauss-Jordan algorithm
with partial pivoting for the solution of general

 It is shown that in many respects suspicions 
are unfounded, and in general the absolute error in the solution
is strictly comparable with that corresponding 
to Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting plus back
substitution.  However, when A is ill conditioned, 
the residual corresponding to the Gauss-Jordan solution
will often be much greater than that corresponding 
to the Gaussian elimination solution.

 The algorithm is similar to those of Rutishauser and

values corresponding to a given compiler-machine

by examining the grammar rules and the program representing
the algorithm one wishes to analyze.  The 
approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines
simple arithmetic expressions.  Two deterministic
parsers are analyzed: a top-down recursive descent
LL(1) parser, and a bottom-up SLR(1) parser.  The 
paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies
of the two parsers.  The estimates applicable 
to a specific machine, the PDP-10, are presented and
substantiated buy benchmarks.  Finally, the paper 
illustrates the proposed approach by applying it to
the analyses of parsers for a simple programming

advantages of using such a transformation include 
the absence of round-off errors and improved computation time

 A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary

algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number 
of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number
of increments are linear in n.  This compares 
very favorably with standard transformation methods.
 If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, 
the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.

of Cobol.  Surprisingly, only four high-frequency errors
were error-prone, which implies minimal error 
inducing design. 80 percent of Cobol misspellings were classifiable
in the four error categories of previous 
researchers, which implies that Cobol misspellings
are correctable by existent algorithms.  Reserved 
word usage was not error-prone, which implies minimal
interference with usage of reserved words.  Over 
80 percent of error diagnosis was found to be inaccurate.
 Such feedback is not optimal for users, particularly 
for the learning user of Cobol.

Numerical Properties  <strong style='color:blue;''>of the</strong>  Ritz-Trefftz Algorithm for Optimal Control

In this paper the Ritz-Trefftz algorithm is applied
to the computer solution of the state regulator 
problem.  The algorithm represents a modification of
the Ritz direct method and is designed to improve 
the speed of solution and the storage requirements to
the point where real-time implementation becomes 
feasible.  The modification is shown to be more stable
computationally than the traditional Ritz approach. 
 The first concern of the paper is to describe the
algorithm and establish its properties as a valid 
and useful numerical technique.  In particular such useful
properties as definiteness and reasonableness 
of condition are established for the method.  The second
part of the paper is devoted to a comparison 
of the new techniques with the standard procedure of
numerically integrating a matrix Riccati equation 
to determine a feedback matrix.  The new technique is
shown to be significantly faster for comparable 
accuracy.

the number of floating-point operations required to
solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where 
k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.  If the
elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals

entire LU decomposition takes k words of storage,

 Upper and lower bounds on k are obtained

A Card Format for Reference Files  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Information Processing

This paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  An 80-column IBM card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  The reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
The identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  The 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

A Unify <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Computational Method for the
Analysis of Complete Factorial Experiments

A computational method which may be used for
the calculation of sums of squares in the analysis 
of variance of complete factorial experiments and in
the computation of main effect or interaction means 
is described.  The method is elucidated as unifying since
one method can be used for a variety of purposes 
each previously requiring different methods.  The programming
advantages of such a method are obvious. 
 The following variants are discussed: (1) the standard
analysis of variance; (2) analyses omitting certain 
levels of one or more factors; (3) separate analyses
for some levels of a factor or for combinations 
of levels of more than one factor.  These are performed
simultaneously; (4) the calculation of main effect 
or interaction means.  The mean expects the data in standard
order and it leaves the data in that order 
so that many analyses of the same data can be performed
without rearrangement.  The total sum of squares, 
excluding a replication sum of squares, is partitioned
into all polynomial partitions and their interactions 
each with one degree of freedom.  This is so even
if factors have unequally spaced factor levels.

The problem of approximation to a given function,
or of fitting a given set of data, where 
the approximating function is required to have certain
of its derivations of specified sign over the 
whole range of approximation, is studied.  Two approaches
are presented, in each of which quadratic programming 
is used to provide both the constraints on the derivatives
and the selection of the function which yields 
the best fit.  The first is a modified Bernstein polynomial
scheme, and the second is a spline fit.

Further Remarks on L <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> e Segment Curve-Fitting Using Dynamic Programming

In a recent paper, Bellman showed how dynamic
programming could be used to determine the solution 
to a problem previously considered by Stone.  The problem
comprises the determination, given N, of the 
N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and
the corresponding line segments, that give the 
best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval.
 Bellman confined himself primarily to the 
analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however,
how the solution of the equation derived for each 
particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to
a discrete search.  In this paper, the computational 
procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities
to some of Stone's equations are indicated. 
 It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving
no minimization may be found.  In addition, 
it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the
curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints 
are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve.

The second Remes algorithm as originally established
for polynomials, may converge or not when 
the approximating functions are rational.  However, the
few results known in this domain show how efficient 
the algorithm can be to obtain approximations with a
small error, much more than in the polynomial case, 
in which the best approximation can be very nearly
approached directly by a series development.  The 
aim of this paper is to investigate the limitations
of the applicability of certain extensions of the 
algorithm to the case where the approximations are rational
as well as to present some numerical results.

An algorithm is described based on Newton's
method which simultaneously approximates all zeros 
of a polynomial with only real zeros.  The algorithm, which
is conceptually suitable for parallel computation, 
determines its own starting values so that convergence
to the zeros is guaranteed.  Multiple zeros and 
their multiplicity are readily determined.  At no

Initial Experience With an Operat <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Multiprogramming System

The Lewis Research Center has been using various
forms and degrees of program simultaneity 
in the operation of its modified Sperry-Rand Univac Scientific
Model 1103 computer during the last five 
years.  This simultaneity has evolved from an initial
achievement of self-searching input and output 
to the automatic time sharing of independently coded
problems.  Several important machine and program 
system modifications were necessary to accomplish this
evolution.  Several additional modifications, 
although not required, were added to facilitate ease
of coding and operation.  All modifications had 
to proceed at a relatively temperate pace to insure that
the basic data-reduction work load of the computing 
center was completed on schedule.  Some educationally
valuable mistakes were made, and their suggested 
cures often pointed the way to useful future improvements
or emphasized some of the basic principles 
of a multiprogramming system.  The material that follows
is a description of the evolution of the programming 
and hardware system which has developed into the present
multiprogramming system at Lewis research Center.

Recent developments  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  optimizing techniques
have allowed a new design for compilers to emerge. 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into
lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  Each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

When accumulating a large number of quantities

An Improved Program-Synthesiz <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Algorithm and Its Correctness

An improved program-synthesizing algorithm
based on the algorithm proposed by Waldinger and 
Lee in 1969 is given.  In the old algorithm, the program-synthesizing
problem is translated into a theorem-proving 
problem, and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof.
 For the improved algorithm, the analysis is 
not necessary, and a program is obtained as soon as
the proof is completed.  This is achieved by using 
a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by Green
in 1969.  The correctness of the improved algorithm 
is also proved; i.e. the program thus obtained
always satisfies the specification.

Cover <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Edges by Cliques with Regard to
Keyword Conflicts and Intersection Graphs

Kellerman has presented a method for determining
keyword conflicts and described a heuristic 
algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial optimization
problem in connection with this method.  
This optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent
to the problem of covering the edges of a graph 
by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing
the number of complete subgraphs.  A relationship 
between this edge-clique-cover problem and the graph coloring
problem is established which allows algorithms 
for either one of these problems to be constructed
from algorithm for the other.  As consequences of 
this relationship, the keyword conflict problem and the
edge-clique-cover problem are shown to be NP-complete, 
and if P=/NP then they do not admit polynomial-time approximation
algorithms which always produce solutions 
within a factor less than 2 from the optimum.

elsewhere that if relative error is used as the 
measure of goodness of fit, optimal results are not
obtained when the initial approximation is a best 
fit.  It is shown here that if, instead, the so-called
logarithmic error is used, then a best initial

of the logarithmic error appears to simplify the

The ACM Committee on Computer Education for Management,
supported by a National Science Foundation 
Grant, is established to appraise the state of the art
and to develop a series of recommendations for 
improving computer education for management.  To provide
the Committee with material for its study of 
curricular needs, five regional meetings in the United
States were held in 1970, at each of which a broad 
cross section of invited academicians and practitioners
considered the state of curricula in business 
schools.  Three topics were covered: curricula for
the general manager; computer-related material in 
required and functional courses; and curricula for students
concentrating on computer-based information 
systems.  An analysis of the minutes of the meetings
revealed a common set of experiences which raised 
similar pedagogic and economic issues.  This presentation
gives a summary of the discussions; a condensation
of the pedagogic and substantive concerns raised; and
consideration of the resource allocation issues 
involved.  Preliminary to the Committee's recommendations
for improving computer education for management, 
this report has been prepared to provide the participants
and the administrators of their institutions 
with background information for the ongoing task of course
development.  Chairman of the ten-man Committee 
is Daniel Teichroew (The University of Michigan).

single-variable instances of the given polynomial by
Kronecker's method and introducing the remaining 
variables by interpolation.  Techniques for implementing the
algorithm and several examples are discussed. 
 The algorithm promises sufficient power to be used efficiently
in an online system for symbolic mathematics.

Interval Arithmetic Determ <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> ant Evaluation
and Its Use in Testing for a Chebyshev System

Two recent papers, one by Hansen and one by
Hansen and R. R. Smith, have shown how Interval 
Arithmetic (I.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  In the present paper 
a method proposed by Hasen and R. R. Smith is compared
with straightforward use of I. in determinant 
evaluation.  Computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
I. for determinant evaluation.  An application using
I. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a Chebyshev system is then presented.

Methods of Evaluat <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Polynomial Approximations
in Function Evaluation Routines

The method of nested multiplication is commonly
used in function evaluation routines to evaluate 
approximation polynomials.  New polynomial evaluation
methods have been developed in recent years which 
require fewer multiplications than nested multiplication
and may therefore be preferable for use in function 
evaluation routines.  Although some of these methods
do not appear to be practically useful because of 
rounding-error difficulties, several methods of evaluating
low-degree polynomials have been found to 
be satisfactory.  Three such methods are described and illustrated.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2402.html</h3><br/><p>	computers encourages the development of  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong> 
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

Dynamic Memory Repacking

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>probabilistic</strong>  model of a multiprogramming system
is exercised in order to determine the conditions 
under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial.
 An expression is derived for the maximum 
interference that a repacking process may introduce
before the original performance of the system is 
degraded.  Alternative approaches to repacking are discussed,
and the operating conditions that lead 
to improved system throughput through repacking are delineated.

generate code for handling the tedious address 
calculations necessitated by complicated data structures.
 The paper is therefore preoccupied with "indexing 
by position."  The relationship of "indexing by
name" and "indexing by position" is discussed.

to derive the equations of motion of a point mass

it provides a good demonstration of a computer's

hexagonal, and triangular arrays.  The approach to the
development of each algorithm is the same.  Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.  It is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive 
to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield
a thinned image with an overall reduced number of 
points.  It is concluded that the algorithm operating in
conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.

Symbolic Execution  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Program Testing

This paper describes the symbolic execution of
programs.  Instead of supplying the normal inputs 
to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing
arbitrary values.  The execution proceeds 
as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic
formulas over the input symbols.  The difficult, 
yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution
of conditional branch type statements.  A 
particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic
execution for program testing and debugging is 
also described.  It interpretively executes programs written
in a simple PL/I style programming language. 
 It includes many standard debugging features, the ability
to manage and to prove things about symbolic 
expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program
verifier.  A brief discussion of the relationship 
between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.

A survey of machines which are more powerful
than finite automata and less powerful than general 
Turing machines is presented.  It is felt that the machines
in this category are as closely related to 
digital computers as either the finite automata or the
unrestricted Turing machines.  Intermediate machines 
can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memory
to a finite-state machine and then performing any 
or all of the following: (1) restrict the manner in
which the unbounded portion of the memory can be 
accessed, (2) bound the number of steps allowed for a
computation by some increasing recursive function 
of the length of the input, (3) restrict the total amount
of memory available in the same manner.  Examples 
from all three classes and their properties are discussed.

a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, 
questions in the normal situation.  Since the recognition
function succeeds just in case the posed question 
is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data,
or, more correctly, is grammatical in terms of 
the grammar for this set of sentences, sentence recognition
itself is a procedure for retrieving information. 
 When the recognition function succeeds, its
value represents the requested information.

An  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithm</strong>  is described which accepts an arbitrary context-free
grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser for
it whenever such a parser exists.  In the first part of the paper
the definition of a context-free grammar and the working of a
bounded-context parser are recalled.  The notion of reduction class for
a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with
the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated.  Next,
pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes
of a context-free grammar are defined.  Finally, the algorithm is described;
it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible
runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes.
In the second part, the utility of the algorithm is discuss
ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.
The algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the
simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it.

The Restriction Language  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Computer Grammars of Natural Language

Over the past few years, a number of systems
for the computer analysis of natural language 
sentences have been based on augmented context-free
grammars: a context-free grammar which defines a 
set of parse trees for a sentence, plus a group of restrictions
to which a tree must conform in order 
to be a valid sentence analysis.  As the coverage of the
grammar is increased, an efficient representation 
becomes essential for further development.  This paper
presents a programming language designed specifically 
for the compact and perspicuous statement of restrictions
of a natural language grammar.  It is based 
on ten years' experience parsing text sentences with
the comprehensive English grammar of the N. 
Linguistic String Project, and embodies in its syntax
and routines the relations which were found to 
be useful and adequate for computerized natural language
analysis.  The language is used in the current 
implementation of the Linguistic String Parser.

that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings.  Particular
emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  The description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer.  By structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  The matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure.  The method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.

A parsing  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithm</strong>  which seems to be the most efficient general context-free 
algorithm known is described.  It is similar to both Knuth's LR(k) algorithm 
and the familiar top-down algorithm.  It has a time bound proportional to 
n^3 (where n is the length of the string being parsed) in general; it has a 
n^2 bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a large 
class of grammars, which seems to include most practical context-free
programming language grammars.  In an empirical comparison it appears
to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up algorithms studied by Griffiths 
and Petrick.

A Program  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  the Syntactic Analysis of English Sentences

A program is described which produces syntactic
analyses of English sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  The main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of English words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  The form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 Techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need
for dynamic application of certain transformational 
rules are described.   A number of examples of output
produced by the program are given.  The output 
includes timing information.

Automatic Parsing  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Content Analysis

Although automatic syntactic and semantic analysis is not yet possible for
all of an unrestricted natural language text, some applications, of which 
content analysis is one, do not have such a stringent coverage requirement.
Preliminary studies show that the Harvard Syntactic Analyzer can
produce correct and unambiguous identification of the subject and
object of certain verbs for approximately half of the relevant occurrences. 
This provides a degree of coverage for content analysis variables which 
compares favorably to manual methods, in variables which compares favorably 
to manual methods, in which only a sample of the total available text is 
normally processed.

it is shown that this problem is NP-complete 
when k is expressed in unary.  When k is expressed in
binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic

Waves Using A General Wave <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong> m Parsing System

A general waveform parsing system with application
to structural pattern recognition of carotid 
pulse waves is described.  The carotid arterial pulse
wave is of medical importance because of variation 
in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular
disease.  The syntax-driven waveform analysis 
system has been applied with good results to these pulse
waves to detect and measure structural variations. 
 The waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler-compiler
system and allows the user to enter application 
specific information as data.  It is thus general
enough to be applicable to other waveforms.

Transition Network Grammars  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Natural Language Analysis

The use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis
of natural language sentences is described.  Structure-building
actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering,
restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce
deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a
transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a
powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take
advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing.  The
advantage of this model for natural language analysis are discussed
in detail and illustrated by examples.  An implementation of an
experimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly 
described.

 The characteristics used to  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong> m word classes are the
depth in the dependency tree of each word, the 
direction of its governor and the same features for
each of its immediate neighbors. Syntactic rules 
of combination show the relation of a word to its governor
in the depth pattern of the sentence.  The 
system was tested on 400 elementary basic English sentences
including 300 used earlier by Knowlton in 
a different learning parser of all 400 sentences.  After
experience with 300 sentences it was able to 
generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100.
 In accumulative learning trials after the first 
200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately
parsing each new sentence it encountered. 
 It was concluded that the system is adequate for learning
to parse the bulk of basic English but that 
further development is required before conclusions about
its application to ordinary English can be stored. 
 The system is operational and available on
the ARPA/SDC time-shared computing system.

for grammars which contain loops.  The algorithm is
also compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitive
grammars and general rewriting systems, and the difference between
the two types of analyses is discussed.  The algorithm appears to
be complementary to an algorithm by S. Kuno in several respects, including 
the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved.

A Locally-Organized Parser  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Spoken Input

This paper describes LPARS, a locally-organized
parsing system, designed for use in a continuous 
speech recognizer.  LPARS processes a string of phonemes
which contains ambiguity and error. The system 
is locally-organized in the sense that it builds local
parse structures from reliable word candidates 
recognized anywhere in an input utterance.  These local
structures are used as "islands of reliability" 
to guide the search for more highly garbled
words which might complete the utterance.

A Fast Storage Allocator

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>fast</strong>  storage bookkeeping method is described
which is particularly appropriate for list-structure 
operations and other situations involving many sizes
of blocks that are fixed in size and location.  
 This scheme, used in the LLLLLL or L6 (Bell Telephone Laboratories
Low-Level List Language), makes available 
blocks of computer registers in several different sizes:
the smaller blocks are obtained by successively 
splitting larger ones in half, and the larger blocks are reconstituted
if and when their parts are simultaneously 
free.

A System  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Typesetting Mathematics

This paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 The language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  Experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  For typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  For example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  The syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  Output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  The system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

made by means of a program which simulates the 
Turing Machine on the Univac M-460 computer.  Several
algorithms for producing grammars equivalent to 
a given context-free grammar have been considered, and
the increase in recognition efficiency they afford 
has been empirically investigated.

A mechanical procedure is derived for determining
whether a given context-free phrase structure 
grammar is a simple precedence grammar.  This procedure
consists of elementary operations on suitably

set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

thrust of the paper is twofold.  First, it is shown how
the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify 
the process of proving the correctness of an implementation
of an abstract data type.  Second, semi-automatic 
tools are described which can be used both to automate
such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate 
implementation from the axioms.  This implementation
allows for limited testing of programs at design

Formalization  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong>  well-defined synchronization
mechanism can be used to prove that concurrently 
running processes of a system communicate correctly.
 This is demonstrated for a system consisting of 
many sending processes which deposit messages in a buffer
and many receiving processes which remove messages 
from that buffer.  The formal description of the synchronization
mechanism makes it very easy to prove 
that the buffer will neither overflow nor underflow,
that senders and receivers will never operate on 
the same message frame in the buffer nor will they run into a deadlock.

are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed 
dimensions of the array.  Effectiveness of the codes
is increased by introducing a "system check bit", 
which is essentially a parity check on the other parity
bits.  Only three-dimensional codes are discussed 
in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal,
the vertical, and one main diagonal.  However, 
the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions,
as evidenced by the discussion by Minnick 
and Ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit
selection plan used for another purpose [6]. 
 A four-dimensional code, correcting three and detecting
four errors, has been developed; the extension 
to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward.

 The two functions are discussed in terms of the

is some similarity between the idea of a file directory
and a storable object of type context.  Manipulations 
with contexts are then discussed at length.  It is noted
that there is a simple extension of Church's 
Lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of
context manipulation.  Whereas a function can be 
regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
the expression Lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), 
it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction
based upon the first two terms in the equivalent

The paper begins by briefly  <strong style='color:blue;''>describing the</strong> 
Stretch (IBM 7030) computer with special emphasis 
given to the organization and operation of its input-output
equipment.  Physical characteristics of the 
two-disk system (4,194,304 72-bit words, 8 usec-per-word
transmission rate, etc.) are noted.  Timing 
limitations due to arm motion and disk rotation are discussed.
 Applications of disk usage are discussed 
separately for problem programs and for systems programs
such as compilers and the supervisory program. 
Approximately 260,000 words of disk storage are reserved
for the storage of systems programs and the 
subroutine library.  Problem programs, however, are not
currently filed on the disk.  Certain programming 
techniques are discussed for transmitting words between
disk and core storage with minimum delaying and 
interruption of the arithmetic unit.  Dumps on disk are
considered for both recovery from computer malfunction 
and for mathematical or physical developments during
the calculation.  Some comments are made regarding 
the reliability, economics, utility and weaknesses or
limitations of the disk system.  Several possible 
future applications are noted which appear to have disk connotations.

 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were

Game Interpretation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of the</strong>  Deadlock Avoidance Problem

The deadlock avoidance problem may be defined
informally as the determination, from some a 
priori information about the processes, resources, operating
system, etc., of the "safe situations" which 
may be realized without endangering the smooth running
of the system.  When each process specifies its 
future needs by a flowchart of need-defined steps, a global
approach to the phenomenon and its in terpretation 
as a game between the operating system and the processes
allows formalization of risk and safety concepts. 
 The bipartite graph representation of this game may
then be used to construct explicitly the set of safe 
states and to study their properties.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2060.html</h3><br/><p>	Completeness and the Reference Concept

GEDANKEN  <strong style='color:blue;''>is a</strong> n experimental programming language with the following 
characteristics.  (1) Any value which is permitted in some context of the 
language is permissible in any other meaningful context.  In particular,
functions and labels are permissible  results of functions and values
of variables.  (2) Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized
by introducing values, called reference, which in turn possess
other values.  The assignment operation always affects the relation
between some reference and its value,  (3) All compound data
structures are treated as functions.  (4) Type declarations are
not permitted.  The functional approach to data structures and the
use of references insure that any process which accepts some data
structure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless
of its internal representation.  More generally, any data structure
may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary
algorithm for computing or accessing its components.  The existence of 
label variables permits the construction of coroutines,
quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms.
A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language.
Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly.

of  <strong style='color:blue;''>the type of</strong>  multivariate problem that is 
found usually in the biological and social sciences as
well as in medicine.  This approach uses a "logical" 
rather than a "statistical" criterion by which variables
are grouped into a deterministic model.  Algorithm 
are developed by which some variables are kept on for
further analysis while others are eliminated.  
Criteria for the acceptance of a variable as well as the
termination of the searching process are derived 
from information theory.

average contacts with different types of accounts experience one

to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always

concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very

 <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong> pplication of digital computers beyond the 
numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for
human participation in the formulation of certain 
types of computer problems.  By the use of tensor calculus
and a computer language designed to facilitate 
symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been
devised whereby a digital computer can be used to 
do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation
and differentiation. To illustrate the 
techniques involved, a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass 
in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.
 Since this operation involves a formulation in 
terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients,
it provides a good demonstration of a computer's 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the 
numerical data processing stage.  Moreover, this particular
problem serves to illustrate the advantages 
of the mathematical techniques employed.  With the program
prepared for this purpose the computer will 
derive the equations of motion in any coordinate system
requested by the user.   Results are presented 
for the following coordinate systems: cylindrical
polar, spherical polar, and prolate spheroidal.

The characteristics  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong> n interactive software system, intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process, are presented.  The main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  The first one is IMOL, an interactive monitor language,
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design.  The second one is 
COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed
to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; 
it is an  extension of Fortran with graphic-type variables,
so that the designer who is familiar with Fortran need not learn a new 
language.  The application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications.

type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  Relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

A comparative study has been made  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong>  variety
of numerical techniques for fitting experimental 
data of the decay type by forms involving the sums of
exponentials.  Statistical errors of the fitted 
parameters are also calculated.  These methods have been
applied to artificially-generated sets of data 
as well as to the results of experiments with radioactive
tracers on both human and animal subjects. 
 Results show that the values of the fitted parameters
are very sensitive to variations in the fitting 
procedure.  Therefore great care very sensitive to variations
in the fitting procedure.  Therefore great 
care must be exercised in identifying such values with
physical constants.  Although the values of functions 
derived from these fitted parameters which can definitely
be associated with physical entities are generally 
more stable under variations in the fitting techniques,
error bounds can be so large that no great confidence 
can be placed even in them.  It would therefore appear
best to select a uniform technique both for running 
the experiments and for analyzing the data, and then
to consider as significant only relative results 
between one subject and the next.

locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

A Case Study  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong>  New Code Generation Technique for Compilers

Recent developments in optimizing techniques
have allowed a new design for compilers to emerge. 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into
lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  Each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

The use of several levels  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong> bstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

Dynamic verification  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong>  decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  The dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system
being designed and constructed at the University 
of California, Berkeley.  PRIME is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

Implementing Clenshaw-Curt <strong style='color:blue;''>is</strong>  Quadrature,
II Computing the Cosine Transformation

In a companion paper to this, "I Methodology
and Experiences," the automatic Clenshaw-Curtis 
quadrature scheme was described and how each quadrature
formula used in the scheme requires a cosine 
transformation of the integrand values was shown. 
The high cost of these cosine transformations has 
been a serious drawback in using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature.
 Two other problems related to the cosine 
transformation have also been trouble some.  First, the
conventional computation of the cosine transformation 
by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly
at the low frequencies which have the largest 
effect upon the integral.  Second, in case the automatic
scheme should require refinement of the sampling, 
storage is required to save the integrand values after
the cosine transformation is computed.  This second 
part of the paper shows how the cosine transformation can
be computed by a modification of the fast Fourier 
transform and all three problems overcome.  The modification
is also applicable in other circumstances 
requiring cosine or sine transformations, such as polynomial
interpolation through the Chebyshev points.

storage areas.  When an entry is to be filed in 
the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to
place the entry into one of these areas.  If this 
particular area is full, then the entry will be placed
into the slower second-level store, even though 
other areas in the first-level store may have space
available.  Given the N entries have been filed in 
the entire hierarchy, an expression is derived for the
expected number of entries filed in the first-level 
storehis expression gives a measure of how effectively
the first-level store is being used.  By means 
of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a

storage areas into which the first-level store is divided
and the total size of the first-level store.

detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  This problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 The relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  Moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  Some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image

the use  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong> bstractions in program construction. 
 Work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  Of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  This paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU.  By 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  The 
CLU library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile 
time, is also discussed.

 The definition of the precise meaning  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong>  program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

This paper extends the use of the regenerative
property of queueing systems in the analysis 
of simulation output.  In particular, it describes a
sequential estimation method which when used with 
the regenerative property allows results to be obtained
with specified statistical accuracy.  This method 
includes a test to check the normality assumption on
which the sequential procedure relies.  The paper 
illustrates the method using the empty and idle state
as the regenerative state.  A second example then 
describes how using the most frequently entered state
as the regenerative state reduces the chance of 
making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run.
 The paper also described how a variance reduction 
method due to Page [9] can be used to obtain a specified
accuracy with considerably fewer job completions 
than are required when no variance reduction technique is applied.

Optimizing Dec <strong style='color:blue;''>is</strong> ion Trees Through Heuristically Guided Search

Optimal decision table conversion has been
tackled in the literature using two approaches, 
dynamic programming and branch-and-bound.  The former
technique is quite effective, but its time and 
space requirements are independent of how "easy" the
given table is.  Furthermore, it cannot be used 
to produce good, quasi optimal solutions.  The branch-and-bound
technique uses a good heuristic to direct 
the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search
space, since the number of solutions increases 
with the number of test variables according to a double 
exponential.  In this paper we suggest a heuristically 
guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic
programming, recognizes identical subproblems but 
which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal
solutions.  The heuristic search method introduced 
in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above
two techniques.  Compressed tables with a large 
number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first.

These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The
basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,
and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

Block Structures, Indirect Address <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g, and Garbage Collection

Programming languages have included explicit
or implicit block structures to provide a naming 
convenience for the programmer.  However, when indirect
addressing is used, as in SNOBOL, naming constraints 
may be introduced.  Two modifications to SNOBOL are described,
resulting in two desirable consequences: 
(1) naming constraints disappear even when there is
indirect addressing within function definitions; 
and (2) there is a significant saving in the number of
calls to the garbage collector, because some garbage 
is collected, at little expense, each time a function
returns to its calling program.  These modifications 
have been implemented as an extension to a SNOBOL dialect.

The user public wants standardization and
reliable identification of programming languages 
and related services.  One way of achieving these goals
illustrated by the methods adopted for TRAC T-64 
interactive language, and its related family of languages.
 Oppressive rigidity usually associated with 
standardization is avoided by a new accommodation technique
accessible to the user to allow local variations 
with the language.  Explicit standardization of the language
is undertaken at the organizational source 
of the language.  Use of the organizational trademark
(TRAC) on the published standards, and services 
relying upon them, provides a reliable public identification.
 These methods can be usefully applied 
to other programming languages and computer services.

In particular, a program is mapped into an expression

of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding

Automatic Data Structure Choice  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  a Language of Very High Level

SETL is a set-theoretically oriented language
of very high level whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings.  This 
paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this
language.  Among other methods of interest, the 
optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion
and membership to be established, the domains 
and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from
above and below, and the single-valuedness of 
(tabulated) mappings to be proved.  Once facts of this
kind have been established, automatic choice of 
data structures becomes possible. The methods employed
are based upon, and extend, known techniques of 
data flow analysis.

The use of several levels  <strong style='color:blue;''>of abstract</strong> ion has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  An execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  Names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language.   He concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs, organizing systems, and referencing 
data.

A sequential programming language forces the
programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in 
which the operations in his program have to be executed,
even if the order is not relevant to the solution 
of his problem.  The requirement to indicate irrelevant
sequencing can be removed if the language provides 
facilities for specifying a task in a nonprocedural
manner.  In general, a program specified in this 
way will allow concurrent evaluation.  This paper describes
a conceptual framework for a high level programming 
language providing both nonprocedural and sequential
facilities.  Within a program, nonprocedural and 
sequential program modules may be nested freely.

Guides to Teach <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g COBOL

The teaching of COBOL can be divided into
three main subject areas.  They are the syntax of 
COBOL, the use of such syntax in solving any given problem,
and programming concepts.  It is generally 
accepted that some knowledge of the hardware and computer
logic must be possessed by the programmer. 
 The teaching problem arises in determining how thoroughly
a student must know the hardware and logic 
for that computer for which he will write COBOL programs.
 Unfortunately, historical data concerning 
students' programming proficiency is almost non-existent
and, at best, difficult to measure.  How then 
might we approach solving this problem?

Mechanization of the Curve Fitt <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Process: DATAN

A process for fitting a curve to approximate data
and the problem it creates for the engineer-programmer 
is defined.  An approach has also been defined and a system
has been written for the SRU 1107 to mechanize 
a major portion of this process.  The techniques developed
to accomplish the mechanization are largely 
empirical, and are dependent for their information
only on the actual data points.

A Comparison of List-Process <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Computer Languages
(Including a Detailed Comparison of COMIT, 
IPL-V, LISP 1.5, and SLIP)

A detailed comparison is presented of COMIT,
IPL-V, LISP 1.5 and SLIP - four well-known computer 
programming languages which, among them, exhibit all the
principal characteristics of existing list-processing 
languages.  Important common features of list-processing
languages are reviewed: forms of data structures 
which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocation
of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of 
recursive operations.  Principal differences between the
four languages under consideration are detailed: 
representations of data, both by the programmer and within
the machine; methods for storage allocation; 
programming formalisms and special processes available,
including arithmetic facilities; and usability 
in terms of availability, documentation, learning aids
and debugging facilities.  A rough comparison 
shows that all the languages discussed have approximately
the same speed.  Finally, the authors give 
some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these
languages for use in particular problem applications, 
concluding that no one of the languages considered is
distinctly superior in all possible list-processing 
applications.

Requirements for Advanced Programm <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Systems for List Processing

List processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  This paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  A 
system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language
features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  Because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  Three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  Interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

are extended from simple data representation 
and function definition to the iteration statement, the
most important poin t of interaction between data 
and the control structure of the language itself.  A
means of specializing Alphard's loops to operate 
on abstract entities without explicit dependence on the
representation of those entities is in troduced. 
 Specification and verification techniques that allow
the properties of the generators for such iterations 
to be expressed in the form of proof rules are developed.
 Results are obtained that for common special 
cases of these loops are essentially identical to the
corresponding constructs in other languages.  A 
means of showing that a generator will terminate is also provided.

that completely new primitive types can be introduced
into languages through the mechanism of singleton

functions are shown to be definable in the system. 
 It is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment.  The
nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system.  The technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.  The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon. The theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment, conditional, and iterative 
statements.  An appendix is included which presents in

A Data Def <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> ition and Mapping Language

A data definition language i sa declarative
computer language for specifying data structures. 
 Most data definition languages concentrate on the declaration
of logical data structures with little 
concern for how these structures are physically realized
on a computer system.  However, the need for 
data definition languages which describe both the logical
and physical aspects of data is increasingly 
apparent.  Such languages will be a key systems, as well
as in advanced data management systems and distributed 
data bases.  This paper reviews past work in the data
definition language for describing both logical 
and physical aspects of data.  Applications of these
"generalized" data definition languages are also 
discussed.

Glypnir-A Programm <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong> g Language for Illiac IV

GLYPNIR is one of the earliest existing languages
designed for programming the Illiac IV computer. 
The syntax of the language is based on ALGOL 60, but has
been extended to allow the programmer explicitly 
to specify the parallelism of his algorithm in terms of 64-word
vectors.  This paper describes the characteristics, 
goals and philosophy of the language, and discusses some
of the problems associated with parallel computer 
architectures.

art, approximately 40 percent of individuals (or households) having
average contacts with different types of accounts experience one
or more errors per year.  Eighty percent relate to billing.  Attempts
to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always
successful. There appears to be some conflict between computer-using
organizations and their public.  Also the role of poor man
agement packages including poor software is indicated.  While most
management systems may be adequate, results of the survey raise
concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very
large linked program packages (as EFT for instance).

the use  <strong style='color:blue;''>of abstract</strong> ions in program construction. 
 Work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  Of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  This paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU.  By 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how CLU programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  The 
CLU library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile 
time, is also discussed.

 The  <strong style='color:blue;''>definition of</strong>  the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>type</strong> , called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  Relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

are defined for different  <strong style='color:blue;''>type</strong> s of arrays, so 
that subarrays may vary over the original array in
a nearly arbitrary manner.  These definitions are 
motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate
the value of partitioning for array languages. 
 Of general interest is the data structure for partitioning.
 This consists of dynamic tree structures 
which are used to derive and maintain the array control
information.  These are described in sufficient 
detail to be of value in the design of other array languages.
 The description presented in this paper 
is implemented in a new array language, OL/2, currently
under development at the University of Illinois.

SETL is a set-theoretic <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> y oriented language
of very high level whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings.  This 
paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this
language.  Among other methods of interest, the 
optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion
and membership to be established, the domains 
and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from
above and below, and the single-valuedness of 
(tabulated) mappings to be proved.  Once facts of this
kind have been established, automatic choice of 
data structures becomes possible. The methods employed
are based upon, and extend, known techniques of 
data flow analysis.

and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  After some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  Technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  The first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  The problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  The use of Cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  This
section also assesses the effect of the Data Base 
Task Group proposals.  The final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>list</strong>  processing languages, illustrate the forms 
described.  Elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands, requirements, or implicit 
specifications.  A command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken.  A requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken.  An implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  An execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  Names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language.   He concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs, organizing systems, and referencing 
data.

 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were

 Specification and verification techniques that allow
the properties of the generators for such iterations

 Results are obtained that for common special

that completely new primitive types can be introduced
into languages through the mechanism of singleton

functions are shown to be definable in the system. 
 It is described how the local environment can be modeled

nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system.  The technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.  The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon. The theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics

tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2060.html</h3><br/><p>	an experimental programming language with  <strong style='color:blue;''>the following</strong>  
characteristics.  (1) Any value which is permitted in some context of the 
language is permissible in any other meaningful context.  In particular,
functions and labels are permissible  results of functions and values
of variables.  (2) Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized
by introducing values, called reference, which in turn possess
other values.  The assignment operation always affects the relation
between some reference and its value,  (3) All compound data
structures are treated as functions.  (4) Type declarations are
not permitted.  The functional approach to data structures and the
use of references insure that any process which accepts some data
structure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless
of its internal representation.  More generally, any data structure
may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary
algorithm for computing or accessing its components.  The existence of 
label variables permits the construction of coroutines,
quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms.
A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language.
Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly.

is designed so as to be especi <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> y suitable 
for use in writing production software systems for a
specific machine (the PDP-10): compilers, operating 
systems, etc.  Prime design goals of the design are the
ability to produce highly efficient object code, 
to allow access to all relevant hardware features of
the host machine, and to provide a rational means 
by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systems
programs.  A major feature which contributes 
to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permitting
the definition of the representation of all 
data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.

almost univers <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> y associated with context-free requirements.
 Yet numerous interesting and difficult 
issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive requirements,
notably the compatibility between the 
declaration of an identifier and its uses, the correspondence
between actual and formal parameters, and 
issues arising from block structure.  This paper explores
the use of a formal notation called Production 
Systems in providing a readable and complete formal definition
of syntax.  As a practical illustration, 
a small but significant subset of PL/I is considered.  A
more detailed presentation, as well as the application 
to define abstract syntax and translations between languages,
is given in a previous paper by the author.

type, c <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong> ed aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  Relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

of the form Z --> cY(1) ... Y(m), (m >= O) where Z and
Y(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal 
symbol.  Since the predictive analyzer at Harvard uses
a standard-form grammar, it can accept the language 
of any context-free Grammar G, given an equivalent standard-form
grammar Gs.  The structural descriptions 
SD(Gs,X) assigned to a given sentence X by the predictive
analyzer, however, are usually different from 
the structural descriptions SD(G,X) assigned to the
same sentence by the original context-free grammar 
G from which Gs is derived.  In Section 1, an algorithm,
originally due to Abbott is described standard-form 
grammar each of whose rules is in standard form, supplemented
by additional information describing its 
derivation from the original context-free grammar. 
A technique for performing the SD(Gs,X) to SD(G,X) 
transformation effectively is also described.  In section
2, the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing 
algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared
with two other parsing algorithms: a selective 
top-to-bottom algorithm similar to Irons' "error correcting
parse algorithm" and an immediate constituent 
analyzer which is an extension of Sakai-Cocke's algorithm
for normal grammars.  The comparison is based 
upon several criteria of efficiency, covering core-storage
requirements, complexities of the programs 
and processing time.

is suggested that Fortran and Cobol will remain

seen to be high quality program literature (i.e. programs)

The Effects  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Multiplexing on a Computer-Communications System

A study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  It is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  Analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 Analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately Poisson.

Exclusive Simulation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Activity in Digital Networks

A technique for simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active digital systems 
is described.  Essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and space, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.  The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.  The passage of
time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous
and asynchronous logic.  Certain aspects 
of the techniques described may be used for the simulation
of network structures other than digital networks.

An extension  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  the buddy method, called the weighted
buddy method, for dynamic storage allocation 
is presented.  The weighted buddy method allows block
sizes of 2^k and 3(2^k), whereas the original buddy 
method allowed only block sizes of 2^k. This extension
is achieved at an additional cost of only two 
bits per block.  Simulation results are presented which
compare this method with the buddy method.  These 
results indicate that for a uniform request distribution,
the buddy system has less total memory fragmentation 
than the weighted buddy algorithm.  However, the total
fragmentation is smaller for the weighted buddy 
method when the requests are for exponentially distributed block sizes.

Various kinds  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  interference between communicating
parallel processes have been examined by 
Dijkstra, Knuth, and others.  Solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,

so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their

that adequate provisions are made for information

A Correctness Pro <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  of a Topology Information
Main tenance Protocol for a Distributed Computer 
Network

In order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot
Potato Heuristic Routing Doctrine."  A correctness 
proof of this Topology Information Protocol is also presented.

Time, Clocks, and the Ordering  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Events in a Distributed System

The concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined, and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.
 A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing 
a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally
order the events.  The use of the total ordering 
is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization
problems.  The algorithm is then specialized 
for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived
on how far out of synchrony the clocks can 
become.

amount of memory resource required for effective 
processing of the I/O activity (buffer space assignment).
 The model studies used both distribution-driven 
and trace-driven techniques.  Even relatively simple dynamic
schedulers are shown to improve system performance 
(as measured by user CPU time) over that given by optimal
or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded 
in identical system structures and workload environments.
 The improvement is greatest under a heavy 
I/O demand workload.

Dynamic Verification  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Operating System Decisions

Dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  The dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system
being designed and constructed at the University 
of California, Berkeley.  PRIME is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

The designer  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  To define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

Two analytic models  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  These models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  Adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  The form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  The modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  Simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

An Overview  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  the ISPL Computer System Design

This paper explores the advantages of the concurrent
design of the language, operating system, 
and machine (via microcode) to create an interactive programming
laboratory.  It describes the synergistic 
effect that the freedom to move and alter features from
one of these domains to another has had on the 
design of this system (which has not been implemented).
 This freedom simplified both incremental compilation 
and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the
communication mechanisms enabling the construction 
of hierarchical subsystems.  It also suggested an important
new concept for operating systems: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource
allocation. This separation enables incorporation 
of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without
endangering the system integration (correctly 
performing the scheduling decisions).

Analysis  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra

Analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  These results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  A major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to Markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  Since many physical
systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.

The problem  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  sharing data among asynchronous
process is considered.  It is assumed that only 
one process at a time can modify the data, but concurrent
reading and writing is permitted.  Two general 
theorems are proved, and some algorithms are presented
to illustrate their use.  These include a solution 
to the general problem in which a read is repeated if
it might have obtained an incorrect result, and 
two techniques for transmitting messages between processes.
 These solutions do not assume any synchronizing 
mechanism other than data which can be written
by one process and read by other processes.

Estimates  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Distributions of Random Variables
for Certain Computer Communications Traffic Models

A study of multiaccess computer communications has
characterized the distributions underlying an elementary
 model of the user-computer interactive process.  The model used is
elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model.  Data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to
be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the
same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. 
It is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to
describe the discrete variables.  Approximations to the gamma distribution
by the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.

availability are defined as fundamental measures

as well as pitfalls which may be encountered

that the cross-correlation between a model and

a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2494.html</h3><br/><p>	Computer Generated Aid for Cluster Analysis

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>computer</strong>  generated graphic method, which
can be used in conjunction with any hierarchical 
scheme of cluster analysis, is described and illustrated.
 The graphic principle used is the representation 
of the elements of a data matrix of similarities or dissimilarities
by computer printed symbols (of character 
overstrikes) of various shades of darkness, where a
dark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity. 
 The plots, applied to a data matrix before clustering
and to the rearranged matrix after clustering, 
show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any
distinctive clusters.  A well-known set of data 
consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests
is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings 
by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis.

An on-line digital  <strong style='color:blue;''>computer</strong>  processing system is considered in which an 
ordinary telephone is the complete terminal device, input to the computer 
being provided as a sequence of spoken words, and output to the user being 
audio responses from the machine.  The feasibility of implementing such a 
system with a FORTRAN-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is 
considered.  Details of a specific word recognition program are given.  This 
technique depends on three simplifying restrictions, namely, a "small"
vocabulary set, "known" speakers, and a "moment of silence"
between each input word.  Experimental results are presented giving
error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine 
resources required to accommodate several users at a time. The results show 
that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at 
least 40 users at a time with an IBM 360/65 computer.

characterize the computer being simulated constitutes 
one major portion of a simulation system.  Four general

are defined.  Toward greatly increased efficiency of a simulation
system, methods are presented for simultaneously 
evaluating many functions for one set of values of the
variables,and for evaluating simultaneously one

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>performance</strong>  of information retrieval systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1805.html</h3><br/><p>	Multiprogramming as it is discussed here is
a mode of  <strong style='color:blue;''>computer</strong>  operation in which two or more
programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,
each using the same central processor unit 
(CPU) and input-output (I/O) channels.  These programs
are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, 
according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.
 It is useful to be able to represent them 
as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each
at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other
programs.  The effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents and simulation has 
been the best available method of predicting it.  This
paper presents the results of progress in developing 
an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
computation of these rates under certain 
situations.  The algorithm is sensitive to most of the
factors that control the phenomenon, including 
nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2344.html</h3><br/><p>	these variations on 
a measure of system  <strong style='color:blue;''>performance</strong>  is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-3132.html</h3><br/><p>	for Pattern Classification

In two-class  <strong style='color:blue;''>pattern recognition</strong> , it is a standard
technique to have an algorithm finding hyperplanes
which separates the two classes in a linearly separable training
set.  The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all
points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered
in the empty space between the two classes.  Since a central
hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have
a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better
than a noncentral hyperplane.  Six algorithms for finding central
hyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  Although frequently
used practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. 
Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be
quite good.

and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  There are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  The users' speed of problem-solving and their

system.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2215.html</h3><br/><p>	Sequential Pattern Recognition

A sequential  <strong style='color:blue;''>pattern recognition</strong>  (SPR) procedure
does not test all the features of a pattern 
at once.  Instead, it selects a feature to be tested.  After
receiving the result of that test, the procedure 
either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another
feature to be tested, etc.  Medical diagnosis 
is an example of SPR.  In this paper the authors suggest
that SPR be viewed as a one-person game played 
against nature (chance).  Virtually all the powerful techniques
developed for searching two-person, strictly 
competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
directly or by analogy into SPR procedures. 
 In particular, one can incorporate the "mini average
backing-up procedure" and the "gamma procedure," 
which are the analogues of the "minimax backing-up procedure"
and the "alpha-beta procedure," respectively. 
 Some computer simulated experiments in character recognition
are presented.  The results indicate that 
the approach is promising.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  last, in marked contrast to representation as a
collection of edges as was heretofore the common 
procedure.  Output polygons have an identical format,
with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe 
any newly-cut edge or edges.  The algorithms easily handle
the particularly difficult problem of detecting 
that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the
clipping window.  The algorithms described achieve 
considerable simplicity by clipping separately against
each clipping plane or window boundary.  Code 
capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary
is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. 
 Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only
two vertex values and may begin its processing 
as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding
stage is ready.  Because the same code is reentered 
for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping
against very complex window shapes is practical. 
 For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane
truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping 
volume.  The two additional planes parallel to the projection
screen serve to limit the range of depth

Pictorial Pattern Recognition  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  the
Phase Problem of X-ray Crystallography

The availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

Computer Generation of Gamma R <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong> om Variates
with Non-integral Shape Parameters

When the shape parameter, a, is integral,
generating gamma random variables with a digital 
computer is straightforward.  There is no simple method
for generating gamma random variates with non-integral 
shape parameters.  A common procedure is to approximately
generate such random variables by use of the 
so-called probability switch method.  Another procedure,
which is exact, is due to Johnk.  This paper 
presents a rejection method for exactly generating
gamma random variables when a is greater than 1.  
The efficiency of the rejection method is shown to
be better than the efficiency of Johnk's method.  
The paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following
mix of procedures yields the best combination 
of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when a is less than
1, use Johnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than a 
and a is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when
a is greater than 5, use the probability switch 
method.

Attribute grammars are an extension of context-free
grammars devised by Knuth as a mechanism 
for including the semantics of a context-free language
with the syntax of the language.  The circularity 
problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics
for all possible sentences (programs) in 
fact will be well defined.  It is proved that this problem
is, in general, computationally intractable. 
 Specifically, it is shown that any deterministic algorithm
which solves the problem must for infinitely 
many cases use an exponential amount of timen improved
version of Knuth's circularity testing algorithm 
is also given, which actually solves the problem within exponential time.

to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure

the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,

time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.  All widths are calculated 
for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons
are given.  Substantial variation in width-at-angle 
magnitude is found.  The principal conclusion is that
the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern 
feature when it can be easily computed.  Further investigation
of the information contained in only part

This paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  The properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  This problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 The relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  Moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  Some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

A new method for generating random variables
from the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape

other methods recently given by Wallace and Fishman. 
 It is compared with Fishman's and Ahrens and Dieter's methods.
 The core storage requirements and programming 
effort for this method are similar to those of Fishman's
method.  The proposed method is the same as 
Fishman's method for 1 < a < 2 and is faster than Fishman's
method for 3 < a < 19.  Also, the proposed 
method is much simpler than Ahrens and Dieter's method and is faster for a < 8.

Texture  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Reflection in Computer Generated Images

In 1974 Catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  The intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  The patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 The amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping

The quality of  <strong style='color:blue;''>computer</strong>  generated images of
three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading 
technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray
tube screen.  The shading algorithm itself depends 
in part on the method for modeling the object, which
also determines the hidden surface algorithm.  The 
various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden
surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. 
 Several shading techniques corresponding to different
methods of object modeling and the related hidden 
surface algorithms are presented here.  Human visual
perception and the fundamental laws of optics are 
considered in the development of a shading rule that
provides better quality and increased realism in 
generated images.

The computational procedure for the  <strong style='color:blue;''>analysis</strong> 
of multiple covariance in statistics is discussed 
with reference to the analysis of variance.  A special
operator calculus developed by Hartly for programming 
analysis of variance for multifactor experiments is extended
to cover the analysis of covariance.  This 
extension is accomplished by utilizing the connection
between the analysis of covariance and the analysis 
of variance and by introducing a new operator.  The
results are illustrated by a numerical example for 
analysis of covariance, in which the basic computations
are shown to be carried out by an analysis-of-variance 
program.

for the computer  <strong style='color:blue;''>analysis</strong>  of natural language 
sentences have been based on augmented context-free
grammars: a context-free grammar which defines a 
set of parse trees for a sentence, plus a group of restrictions

to be a valid sentence analysis.  As the coverage of the
grammar is increased, an efficient representation 
becomes essential for further development.  This paper
presents a programming language designed specifically 
for the compact and perspicuous statement of restrictions
of a natural language grammar.  It is based 
on ten years' experience parsing text sentences with
the comprehensive English grammar of the N.

Autosate

An automated data system  <strong style='color:blue;''>analysis</strong>  technique is
described. The technique is designed to alleviate 
some of the principal problems that beset current analysis-large
data workloads, long span of time between 
project inception and system operational date, the lack
of explicit directions for conducting data system 
analysis and using the results, and the lack of a technique
to control data system changes throughout 
its lifetime. The analysis is geared to determining workload,
relationships and storage characteristics 
of documents in the information network automatically.

The Synthesis of Solids Bounded  <strong style='color:blue;''>by</strong>  Many Faces

A technique is presented which allows a class
of solid objects to be synthesized and stored 
using a computer.  Synthesis begins with primitive solids
like a cube, wedge, or cylinder.  Any solid 
can be moved, scaled, or rotated.  Solids may also be
added together or subtracted.  Two algorithms to 
perform addition are described.  For practical designers,
the technique has the advantage that operations 
are concise, readily composed, and are given in terms
of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences 
of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.

A major problem in using the  <strong style='color:blue;''>analysis</strong>  of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  Even
though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  It is natural therefore to look
to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved 
in computing the interactions.  A program device
to get the computer to do this is described.

 The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  The intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  The patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 The amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  Several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

This paper presents a new approach to  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  In this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  All files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  Using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 All this can be done analytically.  The approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

replace  <strong style='color:blue;''>the use of</strong>  the popular secondary index filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
Through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

In order for  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot

Improving  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  Access Time for Random Access Files

Clustering in the key set is decreased by
smoothing the key-to-address transformation, and 
by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file.  The
keys are pre-hashed before the address division, 
to remove the effect of sequential properties in the
key set.  Shadow buckets in the key search sequence 
reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading,
and decrease the number of maximum probes needed 
to locate a record.  The combined effects of these techniques
lead to improved file performance for secondary 
storage devices, as shown by empirical studies.

suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed

with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving

escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  Two approaches

of the file based on its history and past

of the file with a high probability of being

the database will increase due to structural 
changes caused by updates and insertions.  By reorganizing
the database,the access costs can be reduced. 
 A basic problem is to establish the proper tradeoff between

costs.  This paper considers the optimum points at which
to reorganize a database.  A disk file organization 
which allows for distributed free space is described.
 A cost function describing the excess costs due 
to physical disorganization is defined, and this function
is minimized to obtain the optimum reorganization 
points.  Numerical examples based on the characteristics
of existing disk storage devices are given.

ordering of events.  Direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-3002.html</h3><br/><p>	Record and File Partitioning Model

One of  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  This paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  The probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
The file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  One of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  The model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. 
 This model has already been used in the optimization of
library routines' storage at a large scale operating 
system.

certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies

as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing

 The source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.  Then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied. 
 Some measurements of line efficiency for the ARPANET are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements

(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
Through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

these codes is that they can accept conventionally

 Consequently, clinical test results need

in any way to be coded.  This paper describes 
how the codes were developed and presents a listing of the
urin analysis codes.  Five criteria used in developing 
the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous

the problem is described.  Flexible, computer-produced,
composite laboratory reports are also discussed, 
along with reproduction of such a report. The paper concludes
that even though many problems remain unsolved, 
the next ten years could witness the emergence of a practical
automated information system in the laboratory.

Predicting  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  performance of a proposed automatically
managed multilevel memory system requires 
a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the
information stored in the memory.  Some recent 
experimental measurements on the Multics virtual memory
suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably 
simple program reference model will suffice.  The simple
model combines the effect of the information 
reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management
algorithm to produce a single, composite 
statement: the mean number of memory references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the 
size of the paging memory.  The resulting model is easy
to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse 
problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,
arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, 
and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2033.html</h3><br/><p>	The computational factors considered are  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  size of the hash area
(space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the 
given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  The new methods 
are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded 
information from that associated with conventional methods.  The reduction in 
space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident
hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

 Moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problems
of handling material such as off line encrypted

complete character transparency.  It does not cover 
concepts of transparency in which the normal character

the tracker system.  The system basically consists of
an optical sensor, digital computer and tracker

Establishment of  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation

The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  Two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  These principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. 
 The main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  The first contribution
to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  These
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews.
 The indexing system is described in detail. 
 The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the Repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed

with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving

escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies

Automatic  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  programs require
the manipulation of a variety of different 
data structures, including linear text, sparse matrices,
and tree or list structures.  The main data 
manipulations to be performed in automatic information
systems are first briefly reviewed.  A variety 
of data representations which have been used to describe
structured information are then examined, and 
the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring 
implementation.  Advantages of these programming languages
for the retrieval application are examined, 
and suggestions are made for the design of programming
facilities to aid in information retrieval.

The performance of  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

MULTIPLE's proving program (PP) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.  Thirteen 
general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for PP.  A multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.
 Also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  Data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of PP.  A number of experiments were performed to test
the effectiveness and generality of the learning 
program. Results showed that the learning produced dramatic
improvements in the solutions to problems 
which were in the same domain as those used for collection
learning data.  Learning was also shown to 
generalize successfully to domains other than those used
for data collection.  Another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific domain and 
on problems in a variety of domains.  Some variations
of the learning program were also tested.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1665.html</h3><br/><p>	Using Finite State Techniques

The practical  <strong style='color:blue;''>application of</strong>  the theory of
finite-state automata to automatically generate 
lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article
by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed 
at M. as part of the AED-1 system.  This system
accepts as input description of the multicharacter 
items or of words allowable in a language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

Expanding  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  Editing Function In Language Data Processing

In automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  This paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "Heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  Other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  Applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  Applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone.

A standard  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  operation is
to determine which records in a data collection 
satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values.
 The process of locating the desired responses 
can be represented by a tree search model.  This paper
poses an optimization problem in the design of 
such trees to serve a well-specified application. The
problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily 
the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical
techniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially 
useful for the comparison it affords between observed
performance and that of an intuitively attractive 
ideal search procedure.  As a practical application
of such a model this paper considers the design of 
a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation
of data and shows that essentially the 
same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal
search tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental 
study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.

by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program.  The basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object

sentences.  This procedure makes  <strong style='color:blue;''>use of</strong>  a sentence recognition
device for the class of grammars which 
will correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical
sentences of a natural language.  It 
is possible to make use of a recognition device of this
sort for the following reason: Much data is fully 
expressible as a set of sentences in a natural language,
a set which can be exhaustively and exclusively 
generated by a grammar.  Based upon the rules of this grammar,
a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, 
questions in the normal situation.  Since the recognition
function succeeds just in case the posed question 
is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data,
or, more correctly, is grammatical in terms of 
the grammar for this set of sentences, sentence recognition
itself is a procedure for retrieving information. 
 When the recognition function succeeds, its
value represents the requested information.

Storage and Search Properties  <strong style='color:blue;''>of a</strong>  Tree-Organized Memory System

A memory with list properties [1] may be used
to construct numeric, alphabetic or alphanumeric 
trees.  Such trees have information storage and retrieval
properties applicable to problems involving 
large quantities of data or to problems where the quantity,
word length and distribution of stored information 
is not known a priori, or changes rapidly during the processing.
 The purpose of this paper is to examine 
the storage and search properties of a tree-organized
storage system assuming that a memory possessing 
certain list properties is available.  Of prime interest
is the application where a symbol table, dictionary 
or similar file is to be stored and searched.

A fully automatic document  <strong style='color:blue;''>retrieval system</strong> 
operating on the IBM 7094 is described.  The system 
is characterized by the fact that several hundred different
methods are available to analyze documents 
and search requests.  This feature is used in the retrieval
process by leaving the exact sequence of 
operations initially unspecified, and adapting the
search strategy to the needs of individual users. 
 The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating

of the various available processing methods.  Results obtained
so far seem to indicate that some combination 
of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to
retrieve the wanted information.  A typical search

Establishment of  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation

The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  Two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  These principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. 
 The main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  The first contribution
to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  These
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews.
 The indexing system is described in detail. 
 The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the Repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

 A system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor
memory, computer core memory, extended core 
storage, disk memory, and data cells.  Equations are derived
to predict the effect of such a system on 
data access times using sequential files, random access files,
and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical

systems are highlighted: good interactive

data communication mechanisms.  Interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1032.html</h3><br/><p>	Retrieval Systems

Information storage and  <strong style='color:blue;''>retrieval system</strong> s are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  For identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  Two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  One is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being 
relevant.

The performance of  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval system</strong> s
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

 This study is  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  first known attempt to evaluate 
two such systems for what may well be the predominant user
population within the next decade-the professionals 
who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an
aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather 
than as a programming end in itself.  Statistically
and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  There are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  The users' speed of problem-solving and their
attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable 
system.

property of queueing systems in the analysis

sequential estimation method which when used with 
the regenerative property allows results to be obtained
with specified statistical accuracy.  This method 
includes a test to check the normality assumption on
which the sequential procedure relies.  The paper 
illustrates the method using the empty and idle state
as the regenerative state.  A second example then 
describes how using the most frequently entered state
as the regenerative state reduces the chance of 
making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run.
 The paper also described how a variance reduction 
method due to Page [9] can be used to obtain a specified
accuracy with considerably fewer job completions 
than are required when no variance reduction technique is applied.

A standard  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  operation is
to determine which records in a data collection 
satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values.
 The process of locating the desired responses 
can be represented by a tree search model.  This paper
poses an optimization problem in the design of 
such trees to serve a well-specified application. The
problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily 
the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical
techniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially 
useful for the comparison it affords between observed
performance and that of an intuitively attractive 
ideal search procedure.  As a practical application
of such a model this paper considers the design of 
a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation
of data and shows that essentially the 
same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal
search tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental 
study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.

Users of  <strong style='color:blue;''>linear programming</strong>  computer codes have
realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity, 
effectiveness, and accuracy of the solutions provided
by such codes.  Large scale linear programming 
codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct
solutions without ever having been "bench-marked" 
by test problems with known solutions.  The reason for
this failure to adequately test the codes is that 
rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
available.  This paper presents a theoretical 
justification and an illustrative implementation of a method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions.  The method permits the generation
of test problems that are of arbitrary size 
and have a wide range of numerical characteristics.

Improving Programs by  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  Introduction of Recursion

A new technique of program transformation,
called "recursion in troduction," is described and 
applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems.
 By using recursion in troduction, algorithms 
which manipulate a stack are first translated into
recursive algorithms in which no stack operations 
occur.  These algorithms are then subjected to a second
transformation, a method of recursion elimination 
called "tabulation," to produce programs with a very
efficient running time.  In particular, it is shown 
how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of Knuth,
Morris, and Pratt can be derived in a few steps 
from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm.

 The method described is suitable for parallel

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>use of</strong>  several levels of abstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and

data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure

Use of  <strong style='color:blue;''>linear programming</strong>  models has grown so
extensively in recent years that the whole concept 
for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical
change.  It no longer is adequate merely to reduce 
a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to
a computer code.  An advanced code must cope with 
such a variety of situations that the respective computer
subprograms must be organized into an integrated 
system.  Emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying
principles upon which future linear programming 
systems must be based.  These viewpoints are influenced
by the new demands that applications within the 
petroleum industry are placing on such systems.  Some
of the components of such a system are: translation 
of problem statement in terms of basic data to linear
programming matrix coefficients, data transmission 
for direct computer entry, data file at the computer center,
data processing and editing prior to solving 
the simplex algorithm, an efficient and reliable code
for solving the above-mentioned algorithm, and 
flexible means for summarizing the results.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2081.html</h3><br/><p>	introduced with the intention of developing  <strong style='color:blue;''>data structures</strong> 
suitable for a high level algorithmic language for mathematical programming.  
The paper investigates how the special structure of matrices can be described
and utilized for efficient computing by saving memory space and
superfluous operations.  Sequences of Matrices (and sequences of sequences
of matrices) are considered, and matrix operators areext
ended to sequence operators and cumulative operators.  Algorithms
are given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so
as to find the forms best suited for computation.  These forms are
called normal forms.  Several completeness results are obtained
in the sense that for each expression an equivalent expression
in normal form can be found within a specified calculus.

which separates  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  two classes in a linearly separable training
set.  The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all
points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered
in the empty space between the two classes.  Since a central
hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have
a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better
than a noncentral hyperplane.  Six algorithms for finding central
hyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  Although frequently
used practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. 
Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be
quite good.

large LP problems would doubtless benefit from 
an input system more suited for bulk data handling than
the input code described.  From a user's standpoint, 
input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation
of the LP problem (limited only by a keypunch's 
inability to write subscripts, etc.).  The input interpreter
scans column wise, thus no fixed format

different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory
solution.  Activities of users at terminals and most application
programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation
of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation 
are changed.  Change in data representation will often be needed as a result 
of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the 
types of stored information.  Existing noninferential, formatted data systems 
provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network 
models of the data.  In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.
A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations,
and the concept of a universal form for data base relations,
and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.  In
Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical
inference) are discussed and applied to the problems
of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.

It is important for two reasons: (1) the systems designer

important objective of the curriculum recommendations

to a main report which analyzes  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  features 
of generalized data base management systems.  This introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  After some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  Technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  The first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  The problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  The use of Cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  This
section also assesses the effect of the Data Base 
Task Group proposals.  The final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

On  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  Implementation of Security Measures in Information Systems

The security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  A set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  Distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  The model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  A system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 This system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  The source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  Using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function

for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving

escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies

of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being

The current  <strong style='color:blue;''>role of</strong>  computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  A new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 Methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  The proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for information retrieval and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

The performance  <strong style='color:blue;''>of information retrieval</strong>  systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are
only one bit long.  In the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage
requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  This 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.
 First the C-trie is analyzed as a data

for relatively static databases are discussed.

to summarize  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  methods that have been developed for syntactic, semantic,
and logical analysis of English strings.  It is concluded
that at least minimally effective techniques have been devised for
answering questions from natural language subsets in small scale
experimental systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guide
research efforts in the field.  Current approaches to semantic
analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings
but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of 
meaning or to applications over large subsets of English. 
Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing 
systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries-with
correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems-may entail
a new order of complexity and require the invention and development
of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and questions answering.

Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors.  The algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time.  A realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted.  A procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time O(k log
n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k an arbitrary 
integer.  The model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location.

of synchronizing  <strong style='color:blue;''>processors in</strong>  a multiprocessor 
system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions.
 An interlock scheme called read-interlock, 
which does not require memory-pause instructions, has
been developed for a dual DEC PDP-10 system with 
real-time requirements.  The read-interlock method does
require a special"read-interlock" instruction 
in the repertoire of the processors and a special "read-interlock"
cycle in the repertoire of the memory 
modules.  When a processor examines a "lock" (a memory
location) with a read-interlock instruction, it 
will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining
a lock immediately sets it if it was not already 
set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). 
Writing into a lock clears it.  Having the processor 
interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of
branching is advantageous if the branch would have 
resulted in an effective interrupt.

Theoretical Considerations  <strong style='color:blue;''>in</strong>  Information Retrieval Systems

Information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  For identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  Two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  One is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being 
relevant.

The performance of  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  systems.  It has the same underlying
m-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is 
a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the
nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are
only one bit long.  In the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage
requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  This 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.
 First the C-trie is analyzed as a data 
structure, and then several methods of its use
for relatively static databases are discussed.

the previous best parallel merging algorithm, 
Batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m

subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing
memory and processor time requirements.  This 
observation is valid for configurations ranging from
a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to 
multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory.  If the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in 
parallel exceeds the number of available processors,
then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed.  A procedure is given which combines this
requirement with the earlier ordering considerations 
to provide an optimal execution sequence.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1811.html</h3><br/><p>	question of whether it is possible to program 
 <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong> -processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when N processors are applied approaches
1/N times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  problem whose solution
is presented here was posed by a technical 
library with limited bubget and personnel.  The solution,
however, is quite general and is applicable 
to many different types of retrieval problems.  Further,the
method of solution makes it possible for 
many groups who have previously dismissed an information
retrieval program as expensive and difficult 
(from a programming stand-point) to reconsider their position,
for the present solution makes it possible 
to install an information retrieval program in less than
three months, and with relatively little equipment.

Matrix Computations with Fortran  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Paging

The efficiency of conventional Fortran programs
for matrix computations can often be improved 
by reversing the order of nested loops.  Such modifications
produce modest savings in many common situations 
and very significant savings for large problems run
under an operating system which uses paging.

Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors.  The algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time.  A realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted.  A procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time O(k log
n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k an arbitrary 
integer.  The model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location.

We present a  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time O(log2n).  An
O(log2n) time bound also can be achieved using only n$n/$log2n)) processors.
The algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure
of a symmetric Boolean matrix.  We assume that the processors have
access to a common memory.  Simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.

location) with a read-interlock instruction, it 
will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining
a lock immediately sets it if it was not already 
set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). 
Writing into a lock clears it.  Having the processor 
interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of
branching is advantageous if the branch would have 
resulted in an effective interrupt.

The Design, Implementation,  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Evaluation of a Working Set Dispatcher

The behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them.
 Recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior,
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed.  Two implementations
along these principles have been reported, but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced.  This report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle, presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior, and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system.

algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which
consist of several subtasks which can be computed 
without knowledge of the results of the other subtasks. 
As an example, a method is proposed for "parallelizing" 
the numerical integration of an ordinary differential
equation, which process, by all standard methods, 
is entirely serial.

 Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in

sufficient conditions under which the list processor never
needs to wait on the collector.  These techniques 
are shown to require at most twice as much processing
power as regular garbage collectors, if they are 
used efficiently.  The average behavior of the program
is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case 
performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also
suitable for measuring the typical behavior of

even though it is operating across a memory-to-storage

of prefolding, which is required when 
the folding is manual, are examined, and a number of

are shown to arise from, or be aggravated by, this
source.  It is concluded that a folding mechanism

processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1665.html</h3><br/><p>	automata to automatically generate 
lexical  <strong style='color:blue;''>processors</strong>  is dealt with in this tutorial article
by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed 
at M. as part of the AED-1 system.  This system
accepts as input description of the multicharacter 
items or of words allowable in a language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed.  A procedure is given which combines this

 <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong> -processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when N processors are applied approaches
1/N times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

When proving that a  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i.e. that the statement
cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program. 
 Here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that
the assumption that a statement is indivisible 
can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as
halting.  Thus correctness proofs of a parallel 
system can often be greatly simplified.

paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete

of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, 
CLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL.  The characteristics of
each are summarized in a series of tables.  The 
implications of this analysis for designers of languages,

 The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now

which none of the more general-purpose packages do and
that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each 
suggests ways in which both current and future simulation

with a finite noncontiguous store  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  The effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior.  The
digital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent 
or time-independent Boolean transformations; each transformation
describing the input-output relationship 
of a model element comprising the network mode.  The
simplicity of utilizing the FORTRAN IV Programming 
System as a digital Network Simulator is discussed an

Texture  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Reflection in Computer Generated Images

In 1974 Catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  The intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  The patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 The amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  Several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

A Si <strong style='color:blue;''>m</strong> ple Algorithm for Computing the Generalized Inverse of a Matrix

The generalized inverse of a matrix is important
in analysis because it provides an extension 
of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices.
 It also has many applications in numerical 
analysis, but it is not widely used because the existing
algorithms are fairly complicated and require 
considerable storage space.  A simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort 
and with no additional storage requirements.  The algorithm
gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) 
= n.  In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of A.  In the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

If one has a set of observables (Z1,...,Zm) which
are bound in a relation with certain parameters 
(A1,...,An) by an equation S(Z1,...;A1,...)=0, one frequently
has the problem of determining a set of 
values of the Ai which minimizes the sum of squares of
differences between observed and calculated values 
of a distinguished observable, say Zm.  If the solution
of the above equation for Zm,  Zm=N(Z1,...;A1,...) 
gives rise to a function N which is nonlinear in the Ai,
then one may rely on a version of Gaussian regression 
[1,2] for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing
set of values.  It is shown here that this 
same minimization technique may be used for the solution
of simultaneous (not necessarily linear) equations.

A Procedure for Inverting Large Sy <strong style='color:blue;''>m</strong> metric Matrices

In the least squares method for simultaneous
adjustment of several parameters, the coefficients 
of the normal equations are the elements of a symmetric
positive-definite matrix.  In order to solve 
the normal equations and evaluate the precision measures
of the resulting parameters, inversion of this 
matrix of coefficients is required.  Many available procedures
for matrix inversion do not take advantage 
of the symmetry.  Thus, when programmed for a high-speed
computer, all n^2 elements must be stored and 
manipulated, whereas only (n + 1)/2 of them are independent.
 In order to allow a computer of given memory 
capacity to handle a larger matrix, the following procedure
for inverting a symmetric matrix has been 
devised.

Machine Calculation of Mo <strong style='color:blue;''>m</strong> ents of a Probability Distribution

A method is presented for the calculation on a
machine of the moments of a probability distribution, 
necessitating little more than n additions and n references
to memory for each moment, instead of the 
minimum of n multiplication, 2n additions, and 2n references
to memory required by the most straightforward 
method (where n is the number of entries in the probability
distribution).  The method is directly applicable 
when a tabulated distribution exists, as when it has
been computed by repeated convolution; but in this 
case it conserves both time and accuracy.

Altran is a complete system for symbolic computation

implemented to handle large problems with ease and 
efficiency.  Considerable effort has been spent to ensure
a minimum amount of machine dependence in the 
implementation, thus permitting the system to be installed
quickly and easily on a variety of computing 
machines.  In this paper a brief description of the language,

Reduction of a Band-Sy <strong style='color:blue;''>m</strong> metric Generalized Eigenvalue Problem

An algorithm is described for reducing the
generalized eigenvalue problem Ax = lambda Bx to 
an ordinary problem, in case A and B are symmetric band
matrices with B positive definite.  If n is the 
order of the matrix and m the bandwidth, the matrices
A and B are partitioned into m-by-m blocks; and 
the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks.
 The algorithm reduces the generalized problem to 
an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band
matrix C whose bandwidth is the same as A and B. 
 The algorithm is similar to those of Rutishauser and
Schwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices 
to band form.  The calculation C requires order mn^2
operation.  The round-off error in the calculation 
of C is of the same order as the sum of the errors at
each of the n/m steps of the algorithm, the latter 
errors being largely determined by the condition of B with respect to inversion.

A proof method, subgoal  <strong style='color:blue;''>induction</strong> , is presented
as an alternative or supplement to the commonly

it can often be used to prove a loop's correctness 
directly from its input-output specification without the
use of an invariant.  The relation between subgoal 
induction and other commonly used induction rules is explored
and, in particular, it is shown that subgoal 
induction can be viewed as a specialized form of computation
induction.  A set of sufficient conditions 
are presented which guarantee that an input-output specification
is strong enough for the induction steps 
of a proof by subgoal induction to be valid.

Experi <strong style='color:blue;''>m</strong> ents with an Automatic Theorem-Prover
HavingPartial Ordering Inference Rules

Automatic theorem-provers need to be made much
more efficient.  With this in mind, Slagle has 
shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replaced
by built-in inference rules when using a particular 
theorem-proving algorithm based upon hyper-resolution and
paramodulation.  The new rules embody the transitivity 
of partial orderings and the close relationship between
 predicates.  A program has been developed using 
a modified version of these rules.  This new theorem-prover
has been found to be very powerful for solving 
problems involving partial orderings.  This paper presents
a detailed description of the program and 
a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it.

 By removing multiple occurrences of courses and then scheduling

 Approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above are

type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  Relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>of programming</strong>  inherited from their common ancestor-the
von Neumann computer, their close coupling off 
semantics to state transitions, their division of programming
into a world of expressions and a world 
of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs 
from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical
properties for reasoning about programs. An 
alternative functional style of programming is founded
on the use of combining forms for creating programs. 
 Functional programs deal with structured data, are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically 
constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
use high level programs to build still higher level
ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.
 Associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms. 
 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written.  Combining 
forms are chosen not only for their programming power
but also for the power of their associated algebraic 
laws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed
behavior and termination conditions for large 
classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems
uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems 
have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one
state transition occurs per major computation.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2265.html</h3><br/><p>	A Model for Type Checking

Most current  <strong style='color:blue;''>programming languages</strong>  treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  The 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions. 
In particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  An application 
to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>proofs of correctness</strong>  have been given for 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

 It is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle.
A special case of the assertions method, which 
is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be
incomplete.  A formalization of "deadlock" is then 
presented. The concept of a "norm" is introduced, which
yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, 
of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
and permits shared global variables.  Correctness 
of certain forms of implementation is also discussed.
 An Appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.

As an example  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  cooperation between sequential
processes with very little mutual interference 
despite frequent manipulations of a large shared data
space,  a technique is developed which allows nearly 
all of the activity needed for garbage detection and collection
to be performed by an additional processor 
operating con-currently with the processor devoted to the
computation proper.  Exclusion and synchronization 
constraints have been kept as weak as could be achieved;
the severe complexities engendered by doing 
so are illustrated.

time can be saved by automating the process of filling

 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure

the application of an algebraic technique

 The proofs are particularly easy to follow and straightforward
to produce because the statements in 
a Lucid program are simply axioms from which the proof
proceeds by (almost) conventional logical reasoning, 
with the help of a few axioms and rules of inference
for the special Lucid functions.  As a programming 
language, Lucid is unconventional because, among other
things, the order of statements is irrelevant 
and assignment statements are equations.  Nevertheless,
Lucid programs need not look much different than 
iterative programs in a conventional structured programming
language using assignment and conditional 
statements and loops.

of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2470.html</h3><br/><p>	is presented which abstracts
the notions  <strong style='color:blue;''>of data</strong>  item, function, and relation. 
 It is argued that the system is more suitable than set
theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and 
accurate description of program semantics.  It is shown
how the system can be used to build composite 
data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing,
structuring, and uniting.  It is also demonstrated 
that completely new primitive types can be introduced
into languages through the mechanism of singleton 
data types.  Both deterministic and nondeterministic
functions are shown to be definable in the system. 
 It is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment.  The
nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system.  The technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.  The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon. The theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment, conditional, and iterative 
statements.  An appendix is included which presents in
detail the formal system governing webs and fen, 
the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.

Pro <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong> s of program correctness tend to be long
and tedious, whereas testing, though useful in 
detecting errors, usually does not guarantee correctness.
 This paper introduces a techniques whereby 
test data can be used in proving program correctness.
 In addition to simplifying the process of proving 
correctness, this method simplifies the process of providing
accurate specification for a program.  The 
applicability of this technique to procedures
and recursive programs is demonstrated.

Verifying Properties  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Parallel Programs: An Axiomatic Approach

An axiomatic method for proving a number
of properties of parallel programs is presented.  
Hoare has given a set of axioms for partial correctness,
but they are not strong enough in most cases. 
 This paper defines a more powerful deductive system which
is in some sense complete for partial correctness. 
 A crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,
which are added to a parallel program as 
an aid to proving it correct.  The information in a partial
correctness proof can be used to prove such 
properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock,
and program termination.  Techniques for verifying 
these properties are presented and illustrated by
application to the dining philosophers problem.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2842.html</h3><br/><p>	is a tutorial introduction to the
theory  <strong style='color:blue;''>of programming</strong>  language semantics developed 
by D. Scott and C. Strachey.  The application of the theory
to formal language specification is demonstrated 
and other applications are surveyed. The first language
considered, LOOP, is very elementary and its 
definition merely introduces the notation and methodology
of the approach.  Then the semantic concepts
of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced
to model classes of programming language features 
and the underlying mathematical theory of computation
due to Scott is motivated and outlined.  Finally, 
the paper presents a formal definition of the language GEDANKEN.

The classical process  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  partitioning an array
into subarrays is extended to a more useful 
array language operation.  Various modes of partitioning
are defined for different types of arrays, so 
that subarrays may vary over the original array in
a nearly arbitrary manner.  These definitions are 
motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate
the value of partitioning for array languages. 
 Of general interest is the data structure for partitioning.
 This consists of dynamic tree structures 
which are used to derive and maintain the array control
information.  These are described in sufficient 
detail to be of value in the design of other array languages.
 The description presented in this paper 
is implemented in a new array language, OL/2, currently
under development at the University of Illinois.

 Only when the language is implemented is assignment
of an explicit syntax necessary.  An example of

Some social aspects  <strong style='color:blue;''>of programming</strong>  are illuminated
through analogies with similar aspects of 
mathematics and natural languages.  The split between
pure and applied mathematics is found similarly 
in programming. The development of natural languages toward
flexion less, word-order based language types 
speaks for programming language design based on general,
abstract constructs.  By analogy with incidents 
of the history of artificial, auxiliary languages it
is suggested that Fortran and Cobol will remain 
dominant for a long time to come.  The most promising
avenues for further work of wide influence are 
seen to be high quality program literature (i.e. programs)
of general utility and studies of questions 
related to program style.

to provide controlled sharing.  The extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

</p><br/><h1>55) anything dealing with star height of regular languages or regular expressions or regular events </h2><br/><h3>	CACM-1223.html</h3><br/><p>	Efficient Object Code

A three-pass compiler  <strong style='color:blue;''>with</strong>  the following properties
is briefly described:  The last two passes 
scan an intermediate language produced by the preceding
pass in essentially the reverse of the order 
in which it was generated, so that the first pass is the
only one which hasto read the bulky problem-oriented 
input.  The double scan, one in either direction, performed
by the first two passes, allows the compiler 
to remove locally constant expressions and recursively
calculable expressions from loops and to do the 
important part of common subexpression recognition.
 Optimization such as the effective use of index 
registers, although as important, is not discussed since
the object code which would be most efficient 
is highly machine dependent.  The discussion is in terms
of a FORTRAN-like language, although the technique 
is applicable to most algebraic languages.

 Functional programs deal  <strong style='color:blue;''>with</strong>  structured data, are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically 
constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
use high level programs to build still higher level
ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.
 Associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms. 
 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written.  Combining 
forms are chosen not only for their programming power
but also for the power of their associated algebraic 
laws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed
behavior and termination conditions for large 
classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems
uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems 
have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one
state transition occurs per major computation.

 <strong style='color:blue;''>height</strong>  balance is maintained for the nodes Iying 
on particular paths.  The number of nodes of a Pk tree
asymptotically grows as a power of the height, 
in the worst case.  A procedure for node insertion is given,
and the class of trees  considered is restricted 
to IPk trees, which are buildable by such a procedure.
 The average behavior of such trees, studied by 
an extensive set of simulation runs, is close to that
of AVL trees.  In particular, the family of IPO 
trees whose main advantage is the reduced number of
restructurings required after node insertion, is 
analyzed.

is by deriving closed-form expressions for their

A Nonrecursive Method  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Syntax Specification

The use of the Kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax, 
in particular of ALGOL, is described in this paper. 
A FORTRAN II computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of Gorn,similar to Gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations, 
is described.  This was applied to numerous smaller
languages, including some sublanguage of ALGOL.  
A hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of ALGOL is given, thus expressing 
the Revised ALGOL 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms, as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned.  This description in many ways is far more
intuitively understood than the previous recursive 
description, it is suggested.  The paper also includes
results of the machine program, which does not 
include a simplification algorithm.

 Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in

sufficient conditions under which the list processor never

are shown to require at most twice as much processing
power as regular garbage collectors, if they are 
used efficiently.  The average behavior of the program
is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case

about the actions to be taken.  An implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  An execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  Names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language.   He concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs, organizing systems, and referencing 
data.

over the more general AVL tree in that only one bit
of balancing information is required (two bits are 
required for the ACL tree).  It is shown that deletion of
an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished 
in O(logn) operations, where n is the number of nodes
in the tree.  Moreover the method is optimal in 
the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order
of magnitude.  This result, coupled with earlier 
results by Hirschberg, indicates that, of the three basic
problems of insertion, deletion, and retrieval, 
only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an AVL tree.

A restriction on  <strong style='color:blue;''>height</strong> -balanced binary trees
is presented.  It is seen that this restriction 
reduces the extra memory requirements by half (from
two extra bits per node to one) and maintains fast

This paper describes how some  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  the semantics
of ALGOL 60 can be formalized by establishing 
a correspondence between expressions of ALGOL 60 and expressions
in a modified form of Church's L-notation. 
 First a model for computer languages and compute behavior
is described, based on the notions of functional 
application and functional abstraction, but also having
analogues for imperative language features.  
Then this model is used as an "abstract object language"
into which ALGOL 60 is mapped.  Many of ALGOL 
60's features emerge as particular arrangements of
a small number of structural rules, suggesting new 
classifications and generalizations.  The correspondence
is first described informally, mainly by illustrations. 
 The second part of the paper gives a formal description,
i.e. an "abstract compiler" into the "abstract 
objct language."  This is itself presented in a "purely
functional" notation, that is one using only 
application and abstraction.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1135.html</h3><br/><p>	on Decision Expressions*

The structure  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented.  Such
a structure, based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  Furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

Simulation models  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  large, complex "real-world"
applications have occasionally earned the 
reputation of eating up hours of computer time.  This
problem may be attributed in part to difficulties 
such as slow stochastic convergence.  However, an additional
problem lies in the fact that a significant 
amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events
in their proper sequence.  This paper presents 
a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning
future event lists in discrete event simulations. 
 There models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness
as the events-list scan problem becomes 
more burdensome.

Automated Printed Circuit Routing  <strong style='color:blue;''>with</strong>  a Stepping Aperture

A computer program for routing interconnections
on a two-sided printed circuit board with a 
regular pattern of lines, pins (terminals), and vias
(feed-through holes) is described.  In this program, 
each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically,
down from the upper pin, through a via, and 
horizontally to the lower pin.  From the top, a virtual
aperture (i.e. a long horizontal slit) is stepped 
down the board.  The planned routing is the basis for
rerouting interconnections within the aperture 
to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the aperture
and to maximize the effective line usage. 
 If a conflict has not been resolved before the aperture
arrives at the lower pin,interconnections are 
deleted to resolve the conflict.  Extensions of this technique
to the control of crosstalk between routed 
interconnections and to the problem of obtaining
100 percent interconnect are also discussed.

of a subset  <strong style='color:blue;''>of regular</strong>  expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

A matrix calculus is introduced  <strong style='color:blue;''>with</strong>  the intention of developing data structures
suitable for a high level algorithmic language for mathematical programming.  
The paper investigates how the special structure of matrices can be described
and utilized for efficient computing by saving memory space and
superfluous operations.  Sequences of Matrices (and sequences of sequences
of matrices) are considered, and matrix operators areext
ended to sequence operators and cumulative operators.  Algorithms
are given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so
as to find the forms best suited for computation.  These forms are
called normal forms.  Several completeness results are obtained
in the sense that for each expression an equivalent expression
in normal form can be found within a specified calculus.

Generation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Optimal Code for Expressions via Factorization

Given a set of expressions which are to be
compiled, methods are presented for increasing the 
efficiency of the object code produced by first factoring
the expressions, i.e. finding a set of subexpressions 
each of which occurs in two or more other expressions
or subexpressions.  Once all the factors have been 
ascertained, a sequencing procedure is applied which
orders the factors and expressions such that all 
information is computed in the correct sequence and factors
need be retained in memory a minimal amount 
of time.  An assignment algorithm is then executed in
order to minimize the total number of temporary 
storage cells required to hold the results of evaluating
the factors.  In order to make these techniques 
computationally feasible, heuristic procedures are
applied, and hence global optimal results are not 
necessarily generated.  The factorization algorithms
are also applicable to the problem of factoring 
Boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomials
encountered in symbol manipulating systems.

Synchronization  <strong style='color:blue;''>with</strong>  Eventcounts and Sequencers

Synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative 
ordering of events in the processes.
A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using 
abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes
to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual
exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control
ordering of events.  Direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed
systems.  The mechanism is defined formally, and then several
examples of its use are given.  The relationship of the mechanism
to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,
eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement
of information matters.  An implementation of eventcount
s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.

Can Programming Be Liberated from  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  von Neumann
Style?  A Functional Style and Its Algebra 
of Programs

Conventional programming languages are growing
ever more enormous, but not stronger.  Inherent 
defects at the most basic level cause them to be both
fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style 
of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the
von Neumann computer, their close coupling off 
semantics to state transitions, their division of programming
into a world of expressions and a world 
of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs 
from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical
properties for reasoning about programs. An 
alternative functional style of programming is founded
on the use of combining forms for creating programs. 
 Functional programs deal with structured data, are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically 
constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
use high level programs to build still higher level
ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.
 Associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms. 
 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written.  Combining 
forms are chosen not only for their programming power
but also for the power of their associated algebraic 
laws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed
behavior and termination conditions for large 
classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems
uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems 
have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one
state transition occurs per major computation.

The ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic
Manipulation brought together over four hundred 
people interested in programming languages designed
for manipulation of algebraic formulas and symbol 
strings, in their applications, and in algorithms for
their implementation.  Twenty-eight papers were 
presented, followed by a lively panel discussion of
future directions.  Evening meetings were arranged 
for several interest groups.  The conference was sponsored
by the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic 
and Algebraic Manipulation.  The program committee consisted
of Chairman Jean E. Sammet, Paul Abrahams, 
Thomas E. Cheatham, Max Goldstein, and Douglas Mcllroy.
 Conference arrangements were made by Lewis C.

The use of  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  Kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax, 
in particular of ALGOL, is described in this paper. 
A FORTRAN II computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of Gorn,similar to Gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations, 
is described.  This was applied to numerous smaller
languages, including some sublanguage of ALGOL.  
A hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of ALGOL is given, thus expressing 
the Revised ALGOL 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms, as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned.  This description in many ways is far more
intuitively understood than the previous recursive 
description, it is suggested.  The paper also includes
results of the machine program, which does not 
include a simplification algorithm.

by D. Scott and C. Strachey.  The application of the theory
to formal language specification is demonstrated 
and other applications are surveyed. The first language
considered, LOOP, is very elementary and its 
definition merely introduces the notation and methodology
of the approach.  Then the semantic concepts
of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced
to model classes of programming language features 
and the underlying mathematical theory of computation
due to Scott is motivated and outlined.  Finally, 
the paper presents a formal definition of the language GEDANKEN.

On  <strong style='color:blue;''>the</strong>  Downhill Method

The downhill method is a numerical method for
solving complex equations f(z) = 0 on which the 
only restriction is that the function w = f(z) must
be analytical.  An introduction to this method is 
given and a critical review of relating literature is
presented.  Although in theory the method always 
converges, it is shown that a fundamental dilemma exists
which may cause a breakdown in practical applications. 
 To avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate of
convergence toward a root, some modifications of 
the original method are proposed and a program (FORTRAN)
based on the modified method is given in Algorithm 
365.  Some numerical examples are included.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1665.html</h3><br/><p>	Techniques

The practical application of the  <strong style='color:blue;''>theory of</strong> 
finite-state automata to automatically generate 
lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article
by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed 
at M. as part of the AED-1 system.  This system
accepts as input description of the multicharacter 
items or of words allowable in a language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

 So far the theories  <strong style='color:blue;''>of automata and</strong>  of nets, though

the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial

and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

Computers and Employment

The  <strong style='color:blue;''>relation</strong> ship of computers and automation
to employment is part of the more general relation 
of technological change to employment.  The most obvious
effect is that increase in productivity due 
to technology can eliminate jobs.  Technology affects
the individual worker, in the nature and amount 
of his work, and in his attitudes toward that work.  Technological
change affects the occupational structure 
of the entire labor force.  Because of the central importance
of these effects, the impact of technology 
has been the subject of extensive study by economists, sociologists,
political scientists, and psychologists. 
 Even within a single discipline, studies are often contradictory,
and conclusions are colored by political 
overtones.  We wish to delineate some of the issues,
and present arguments given to support different 
viewpoints.

Can Programming Be Liberated  <strong style='color:blue;''>from the von</strong>  Neumann
Style?  A Functional Style and Its Algebra 
of Programs

Conventional programming languages are growing
ever more enormous, but not stronger.  Inherent 
defects at the most basic level cause them to be both
fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style 
of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the
von Neumann computer, their close coupling off 
semantics to state transitions, their division of programming
into a world of expressions and a world 
of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs 
from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical
properties for reasoning about programs. An 
alternative functional style of programming is founded
on the use of combining forms for creating programs. 
 Functional programs deal with structured data, are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically 
constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
use high level programs to build still higher level
ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.
 Associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms. 
 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written.  Combining 
forms are chosen not only for their programming power
but also for the power of their associated algebraic 
laws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed
behavior and termination conditions for large 
classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems
uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems 
have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one
state transition occurs per major computation.

A Set  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Basic Input-Output Procedures (Algorithm 335 [15])

By means of the primitives in symbol, outsymbol
and length, as requested by this journal's 
Algorithms Policy [Comm. ACM 10 (Nov. 67), 729] a basic
set of input-output procedures is defined aiming 
at quality and flexibility.  Outreal, for instance, is
written as a derived procedure; it outputs using 
the fixed point or the floating point representation,
and rounds properly.  Variants can easily be written 
because of the explicit call of the procedures decompose
integer and decompose real.  The highly recommended 
practice of echoing input is made easy with one subset
of derived procedures (ioi, ior, iob, ioa).  The 
documentation of output in the form of equivalent ALGOL
statements is also provided when use is made 
of the subset oti, otr, otb, ota.  The Berkeley style
of providing information on the form of output 
using prior calls of procedures such as real format is
defined.  A use of the parameter outchannel to 
provide information for simultaneous output to several
channels is suggested.  Interrelationship between 
the declared procedures is furnished in tabular form.

the sets of sufficient conditions presented can 
be thought of as generalizations of optimality conditions
based on primal-dual complementarity in linear

useful for the construction of difficult integer

in Teaching Cobol Programming

The effectiveness of structured
walk-throughs in teaching introductory Cobol programming was empirically
assessed with a sample of 215 under-graduate business administration
majors.  Cobol proficiency was measured by a final examination
testing (a) knowledge of language rules, (b) ability to read
and debug a program, and (c) the ability to write a program.  Analysis
of multiple covariance was used to statistically adjust test
scores for age and conditional reasoning scores. The findings provide
empirical support for incorporating structured walk-throughs
into the programming learning process more effectively
develop student proficiency in writing Cobol programs.

Social Processes and Pro <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong> s of Theorems and Programs

It is argued that formal verifications of
programs, no matter how obtained, will not play the
same key role in the development of computer science and software
engineering as proofs do in mathematics.  Furthermore the absence
of continuity, the inevitability of change, and the complexity of
specification of significantly many real programs make the form
al verification process difficult to justify and manage.  It is felt
that ease of formal verification should not dominate program
language design.

This paper is concerned with a review and examination
of several existing algorithms for the 
zero-one programming problem.  Computational experience
is summarized.  The machine time and storage 
requirements of several of the algorithms are compared
over several test problems of small and intermediate

of solving problems with over 100 variables with 
a reasonable amount of machine time.

The fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous
to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.
A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the
imaginary unit,  -1, followed by least squares addition of the column
(or row).  The elimination process for the procedure is successive
ssive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient)
form.  These ideas are illustrated with an implementation
of the revised simplex method.  The algorithm is a general purpose
one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity
in the equations.  Some suggested computational tests for determining

algorithm are mentioned.  A simple means of constructing
test cases and some sample computing times are presented.

The use  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  several levels of abstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

The basic ideas  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  nondeterministic programming
are critically reconsidered to single out a 
proper attitude and programming style for language allowing
direct control of nondeterministic features. 
 The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of
the nondeterministic formulation of search processes 
on one level (the attempt level), deferring the coordination
of problem solving efforts to another (the 
choice level).  The feasibility of recognizing these two
levels is discussed, stressing that the structure 
to be managed at the choice level is a free of contexts.
 The leaves are computational environments, 
each holding an alternative under inspection, while
the other nodes are associated with choice poin ts. 
 According to the proposed programming style, a generative
function is associated with each choice poin t, 
which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main
advantage on this approach is the localization 
of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the
tree keeps track of the state of the computation 
as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated,
holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate 
the available alternatives.  Examples are given in
term of ND-Lisp, an extension of Lisp designed and 
implemented according to these guidelines.

A new generation of computer terminals allows

 This feature can be used to reduce the number of characters
that are needed to represent a document 
for transmission and printing.  In this note, an algorithm
is given for selecting the optimal set of 
tab stops for minimizing the number of characters transmitted.
 An implementation of the algorithm has 
reduced the number of characters transmitted by from
7 to 30 percent, but requires a prepass through 
the document to compute a matrix used in determining
the optimal set tab stops.  The use of fixed tab 
stops, as a heuristic alternative, can achieve
about 80 percent of optimal with no prepass.

A procedure for automatic evaluation  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  total/partial
derivatives of arbitrary algebraic functions 
is presented.  The technique permits computation of
numerical values of derivatives without developing 
analytical expressions for the derivatives.  The key
to the method is the decomposition of the given 
function, by introduction of intermediate variables,
into a series of elementary functional steps.  A 
library of elementary function subroutines is provided
for the automatic evaluation and differentiation 
of these new variables.  The final step in this process
produces the desired function's derivative.  
The main feature of this approach is its simplicity.
 It can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the 
derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and
also as a debugging tool for programs which contain 
derivatives.

Analysis  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  the Availability of Computer
Systems Using Computer- Aided Algebra

Analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  These results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  A major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to Markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  Since many physical
systems can be modeled by Markov and semi-Markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.

By virtue of its relationship with logic, the extended

the other hand, by regarding semantic networks as an 
abstract data structure for the representation of clauses, we provide a
theorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-following

 In storing these structures, preserving logical adjacencies

 The combinatorial problem of storing arrays as various
kinds of list structures is examined.  Embeddings 
of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved
in such storage schemes, and an elementary 
proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with
bounded loss of proximity is presented.  Average 
loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shown
that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with 
only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so
stored in binary trees.  The former result implies, 
for instance, that row major order is an asymptotically
optimal storage strategy for arrays.

Reduction: A Method  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  Proving Properties of Parallel Programs

When proving that a parallel program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i.e. that the statement
cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program. 
 Here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that
the assumption that a statement is indivisible 
can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as
halting.  Thus correctness proofs of a parallel 
system can often be greatly simplified.

 It includes many standard debugging features, the ability

The system  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  program and data representation

occupies a block of consecutive memory locations. 
 Each block is labeled by a codeword and may contain
a program, a data vector, or codewords which in 
turn label blocks to form arrays.  This storage arrangement
is discussed with its realized advantages 
or programming systems: simplicity of programmed addressing,
flexibility of data structures, efficiency 
of memory utilization, variability of system composition
during execution, means of linkage between programs 
and from programs to data, and basis for storage protection.
 The application of labeled blocks may be 
extended to areas of time-sharing and multimedia storage

some ideas on such extensions are presented.

Some social aspects  <strong style='color:blue;''>of</strong>  programming are illuminated
through analogies with similar aspects of 
mathematics and natural languages.  The split between
pure and applied mathematics is found similarly 
in programming. The development of natural languages toward
flexion less, word-order based language types 
speaks for programming language design based on general,
abstract constructs.  By analogy with incidents 
of the history of artificial, auxiliary languages it
is suggested that Fortran and Cobol will remain 
dominant for a long time to come.  The most promising
avenues for further work of wide influence are 
seen to be high quality program literature (i.e. programs)
of general utility and studies of questions 
related to program style.

The computational technique conventionally used
for stepwise multiple linear regression requires 
the storage of an n X n matrix of data.  When the number
of variables, n, is large, this requirement 
taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery.
 The near symmetry of the matrices involved permits 
a modification requiring only half the storage and computations
of the conventional algorithm and this 
additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing
more variables.  Alternatively, it permits 
the analysis of problems containing the same number
of variables but with all computations performed 
in double precision.

By typing requests in English, casual users
will be able to obtain explicit answers from a 
large relational database of aircraft flight and maintenance
data using a system called PLANES.  The 
design and implementation of this system is described and
illustrated with detailed examples of the operation 
of system components and examples of overall system
operation.  The language processing portion of the 
system uses a number of augmented transition networks,
each of which matches phrases with a specific 
meaning, along with context registers (his tory keepers)
and concept case frames; these are used for judging 
meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying
partially understood questions, and resolving 
ellipsis and pronoun reference problems.  Other system components
construct a formal query for the relational 
database, and optimize the order of searching relations.
 Methods are discussed for handling vague or 
complex questions and for providing browsing ability.
 Also included are discussions of important issues 
in programming natural language systems for limited domains,
and the relationship of this system to others.

Using linear programming, an interactive graphic
display system has been implemented to solve 
the region design problem of partitioning a region into
N nonoverlapping subregions in such a way that 
their areas are in specified proportions and that the
total cost of servicing them is a minimum.  In 
a conversational manner, a user can easily obtain different
partitionings by specifying and modifying 
the boundary, the service centers' locations, the area
proportions, and the cost functions.  Examples 
are included.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2188.html</h3><br/><p>	Design of Computer Graphics Systems

Display  <strong style='color:blue;''>system design</strong> ers are faced with the
difficult task of selecting major subsystems in 
an intelligent way.  Each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.  The work reported 
here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure
and helps give a better understanding of now 
to  configure display systems.  This is accomplished by
means of a mathematical model of a computer driven 
graphics system.  The parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.
 The model can be analyzed using numerical 
queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average
response time prediction.  By combining the model 
with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,
subject to a cost constraint, is found 
for several applications.  The optimum configurations
are in turn used to find general display system 
design guidelines.

In any prolonged computation it is generally

paper is to give precise descriptions of certain 
probabilistic models for roundoff error, and then to
describe a series of experiments for testing the

are in general very good.  Discrepancies are 
both rare and mild.  The test techniques can also be
used to experiment with various types of special

 The solution to the integral equation indicates that

only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,
but substantially reduces the variance in sorting 
effort.  Statistical tests of the values of several

given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution
function in satisfactory agreement with 
the moments computed from the generating function.  The

A Comparison of the C <strong style='color:blue;''>or</strong> relational Behavior
of Random Number Generators for the IBM 360

Hutchinson states that the "new" (prime modulo)
multiplicative congruential pseudorandom generator, 
attributed to D. H. Lehmer, has passed the usual statistical
tests for random number generators.  It 
is here empirically shown that generators of this type
can produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions 
up to lag 50 exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for many
multiplicative constants.  An alternative generator 
proposed by Tausworthe, which uses irreducible polynomials
over the field of characteristic two, is shown 
to be free from this defect.  The applicability of these
two generators to the IBM 360 is then discussed. 
 Since computer word size can affect a generator's statistical
behavior the older mixed and simple congruential 
generators, although extensively tested on computers
having 36 or more bits per word, may not be optimum 
generators for the IBM 360.

Many computer systems solve executable storage
size problems for large programs by using overlays. 
 However, it appears that no one overlay scheme contains
a well-balanced combination of the most useful 
capabilities which are found in various existing techniques.
 A proposal is presented which utilizes 
several of the best capabilities from existing schemes
and is complemented by several additional features, 
e.g. writable overlays.  The writable overlay capability
provides a virtual memory effect, although the 
programmer may still be required to design the overlay
configuration.  Since overlay structuring is a 
complex task, several tools (including a graphic display)
are included in the proposal in order to aid 
the programmer in the design.  The content of overlays
is briefly discussed, and it is noted that many 
of the details of the final overlay configuration may be decided after the fact.

Algorithms for computing the resultant of two
polynomials in several variables, a key repetitive 
step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
equations by elimination, are studied.  Determining 
the best algorithm for computer implementation depends
upon the extent to which extraneous factors are 
introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by
truncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, 
and computing speed.  Preliminary considerations narrow
the choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's 
determinant and Collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence
(p.r.s.) algorithm.  Detailed tests performed 
on sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant
is superior in all respects except for 
univariate polynomials, in which case Collins' reduced
p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.  In particular 
Bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior in
numerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability 
with regard to round-off errors. Results of tests are reported in detail.

art, approximately 40 percent of individuals (or households) having
average contacts with different types of accounts experience one
or more errors per year.  Eighty percent relate to billing.  Attempts
to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always
successful. There appears to be some conflict between computer-using
organizations and their public.  Also the role of poor man
agement packages including poor software is indicated.  While most
management systems may be adequate, results of the survey raise
concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very
large linked program packages (as EFT for instance).

A Vector Space Model  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Automatic Indexing

In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  An approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

A model of  <strong style='color:blue;''>natural language</strong>  based on an underlying
language-free representation of meaning 
is described.  A program based on this model is able
to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate 
understanding with respect to a given context.  This
generator operates in conjunction with a natural 
language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model.
 In generating sentences from meaning structures, 
the program employs both the information retrieval and
deduction capabilities of the memory model.  The 
model encompasses several diverse classes of linguistic
knowledge, which include: (1) executable tests 
of conceptual properties stored in discrimination nets;
(2) information relating conceptual to syntactic 
roles, stored in a word-sense dictionary, and (3) surface
grammatical knowledge, stored in a formal grammar.

Accommodating St <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong> ards and Identification of Programming Languages

The user public wants standardization and
reliable identification of programming languages 
and related services.  One way of achieving these goals
illustrated by the methods adopted for TRAC T-64 
interactive language, and its related family of languages.
 Oppressive rigidity usually associated with 
standardization is avoided by a new accommodation technique
accessible to the user to allow local variations 
with the language.  Explicit standardization of the language
is undertaken at the organizational source 
of the language.  Use of the organizational trademark
(TRAC) on the published standards, and services 
relying upon them, provides a reliable public identification.
 These methods can be usefully applied 
to other programming languages and computer services.

Improving the Access Time for R <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong> om Access Files

Clustering in the key set is decreased by
smoothing the key-to-address transformation, and 
by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file.  The
keys are pre-hashed before the address division, 
to remove the effect of sequential properties in the
key set.  Shadow buckets in the key search sequence 
reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading,
and decrease the number of maximum probes needed 
to locate a record.  The combined effects of these techniques
lead to improved file performance for secondary 
storage devices, as shown by empirical studies.

Manipulation of data strings is the most complex
processing function in information storage 
and retrieval applications.  Data string manipulation
is discussed within the context of an interpretive 
processing environment controlled by the use of procedural
directives.  The sequence of procedural directives 
is derived from a job assumed to be expressed in a user-oriented
source language.  Each data string with 
the structured data environment (data bank) is explicitly
or implicitly related to a format declaration
residing in a format library.  The processing mechanics
associated with data string manipulation is developed 
in accordance with a generalized data filtering concept.
 This results in the implementation of a two-part 
data filter module that satisfies internal processing
functions by filtering data strings through format 
declarations associated with its input and output ports.

is inserted to mark their separations.  Since 
errors in identification of these control characters

Cooley  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Tukey have proposed a fast algorithm
for computing complex Fourier transform and 
have shown major time savings in using it to compute
large transforms on a digital computer.  With n 
a power of two, computing time for this algorithm is
proportional to n log2 n, a major improvement over 
other methods with computing time proportional to n^2.
 In this paper, the fast Fourier transform algorithm 
is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methods
for accurately computing the needed trigonometric 
function values are given.  The problem of computing
a large Fourier transform on a system with virtual 
memory is considered, and a solution is proposed.  This
method has been used to compute complex Fourier 
transforms of size n = 2^16 on a computer with 2^15
words of core storage; this exceeds by a factor of 
eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixed
allocation of this amount of core storage.  The 
method has also been used to compute large mixed radix
transforms.  A scaling plan for computing the 
fast Fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given.

Establishment of the ACM Repository  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation

The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  Two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  These principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. 
 The main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  The first contribution
to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  These
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews.
 The indexing system is described in detail. 
 The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the Repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

An efficient method of ordered  <strong style='color:blue;''>retrieval of</strong>  binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  Thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  The use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (Thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  In this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2396.html</h3><br/><p>	Simple English

MUSE is a computer model f <strong style='color:blue;''>or natural language</strong> 
processing, based on a semantic memory network 
like that of Quillian's TLC.  MUSE, from a Model to Understand
Simple English, processes English sentences 
of unrestricted content but somewhat restricted format.
 The model first applies syntactic analysis to 
eliminate some interpretations and then employs a simplified
semantic intersection procedure to find 
a valid interpretation of the input.  While the semantic
processing is similar to TLC's, the syntactic 
component includes the early use of parse trees and special
purpose rules.  The "relational triple" notation 
used during interpretation of input is compatible with MUSE's
memory structures, allowing direct verification 
of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones. 
MUSE also has a repertoire of actions, which range 
from editing and reporting the contents of its own
memory to an indirect form of question answering. 
 Examples are presented to demonstrate how the model interprets
text, resolves ambiguities, adds information 
to memory, generalizes from examples and performs various actions.

Since this approach is not always preferable to inversion,

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1665.html</h3><br/><p>	description of the multicharacter 
items or  <strong style='color:blue;''>of words</strong>  allowable in a language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

toward conducting automatic  <strong style='color:blue;''>retrieval of</strong>  natural 
language messages.  To explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program.  The basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  A program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 The authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical
value in man-machine systems using human monitors 
to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence.

be organized under several database organizations, 
including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems.  Effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems.  In particular,
the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

attempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic 
capabilities of the present system are particularly concerned
with increasing the fidelity of the adaptive

the analysis of parallel electrocardiographer-computer

of introducing major, tree-like branching decisions

of different manufacturers, having diverse configurations.  The elements 
common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these 
elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated.
These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The
basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,
and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

of generalized data base  <strong style='color:blue;''>management systems</strong> .  This introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  After some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  Technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  The first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  The problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  The use of Cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  This
section also assesses the effect of the Data Base 
Task Group proposals.  The final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

Maintenance  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  enhancement of application
software consume a major portion of the total life 
cycle cost of a system.  Rough estimates of the total
systems and programming resources consumed range 
as high as 75-80 percent in each category.  However,
the area has been given little attention in the 
literature.  To analyze the problems in this area a
questionnaire was developed and pretested.  It was 
then submitted to 120 organizations.  Respondents totaled
69.  Responses were analyzed with the SPSS 
statistical package.  The results of the analysis indicate
that: (1) maintenance and enhancement do consume 
much of the total resources of systems and programming
groups; (2) maintenance and enhancement tend to 
be viewed by management as at least somewhat more important
than new application software development; 
(3) in maintenance and enhancement, problems of a management
orientation tend to be more significant 
than those of a technical orientation; and (4) user
demands for enhancements and extension constitute 
the most important management problem area.

The functional approach  <strong style='color:blue;''>to database</strong>  design is
introduced.  In this approach the goal of design 
is to derive a data structure which is capable of supporting
a set of anticipated queries rather than 
a structure which "models the business" in some other
way. An operational computer program is described 
which utilizers the functional approach to design data
structures conforming to the Data Base Task Group 
specifications.  The automatic programming technology
utilized by this program, although typically used 
to generate procedure, is here used to generate declaratives.

 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain

of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that

MUSE: A Model To Underst <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Simple English

MUSE is a computer model for natural language
processing, based on a semantic memory network 
like that of Quillian's TLC.  MUSE, from a Model to Understand
Simple English, processes English sentences 
of unrestricted content but somewhat restricted format.
 The model first applies syntactic analysis to 
eliminate some interpretations and then employs a simplified
semantic intersection procedure to find 
a valid interpretation of the input.  While the semantic
processing is similar to TLC's, the syntactic 
component includes the early use of parse trees and special
purpose rules.  The "relational triple" notation 
used during interpretation of input is compatible with MUSE's
memory structures, allowing direct verification 
of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones. 
MUSE also has a repertoire of actions, which range 
from editing and reporting the contents of its own
memory to an indirect form of question answering. 
 Examples are presented to demonstrate how the model interprets
text, resolves ambiguities, adds information 
to memory, generalizes from examples and performs various actions.

The Notions of Consistency  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Predicate Locks in a Database System

In database systems, users access shared data
under the assumption that the data satisfies 
certain consistency constraints.  This paper defines the
concepts of transaction, consistency and schedule 
and shows that consistency requires that a transaction
cannot request new locks after releasing a lock. 
 Then it is argued that a transaction needs to lock a logical
rather than a physical subset of the database. 
 These subsets may be specified by predicates.  An
implementation of predicate locks which satisfies 
the consistency condition is suggested.

Memory Management  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Response Time

This paper presents a computationally tractable
methodology for including accurately the effects 
of finite memory size and workload memory requirements
in queueing network models of computer systems. 
 Empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applying
this methodology to an actual multiaccess 
in teractive system are reported.  Relations between workload
variables such as memory requirement distribution 
and job swap time, and performance measures such as response
time and memory utilization are graphically 
displayed. A multiphase, analytically soluble model is
proposed as being broadly applicable to the analysis 
of in teractive computer systems which use nonpaged memories.

Technique  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Comparison of Languages 

The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison
of some computer simulation languages 
and of some of the involved in comparing software packages
for digital computers are discussed in Part 
I.  The issue is obvious: users of digital computers
must choose from available languages or write their 
own.  Substantial costs can occur, particularly in training,
implementation and computer time if an inappropriate 
language is chosenore and more computer simulation
languages are being developed: comparisons and 
evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers
and implementers as well as users.  The second 
part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation
languages.  The computational characteristics of 
simulation are discussed with  special attention being
paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete 
change models.  Part III presents a detailed comparison
of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, 
CLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL.  The characteristics of
each are summarized in a series of tables.  The 
implications of this analysis for designers of languages,
for users, and for implementers are developed. 
 The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now
available for computer simulation offer features 
which none of the more general-purpose packages do and
that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each 
suggests ways in which both current and future simulation
languages and packages can be improved.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-1844.html</h3><br/><p>	System

An alternative approach to the design  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  The system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  One of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  In the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  A crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 Thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 This system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  Economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  Finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

Computer-Aided Analysis  <strong style='color:blue;''>and</strong>  Design of Information Systems

This paper describes the use of computer-aided
analysis for the design and development of an 
integrated financial management system by the Navy Material
Command Support Activity (NMCSA).  Computer-aided 
analysis consists of a set of procedures and computer
programs specifically designed to aid in the process 
of applications software design, computer selection
and performance evaluation.  There are four major 
components: Problem Statement Language, Problem Statement
Analyzer, Generator of Alternative Designs, 
and Performance Evaluator. The statement of requirements
was written in ADS (Accurately Defined Systems) 
and analyzed by a Problem Statement Analyzer for ADS.
 The ADS problem definition was supplemented with 
additional information in order to create a complete
problem definition.  The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures.

change from the traditional approach to the

it appears to be necessary for the database to 
impose a certain amount of control over the internal
behavior of users' programs which interact with 
it.  A model for user-database interaction
which admits such a control is developed.

a  <strong style='color:blue;''>hardware and software</strong>  scheme for measuring user programs
in a time-shared environment.  The TX-2 computer 
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory was used for the implementation
of such a system and the characteristics of 
this implementation are reported.  A scenario showing
the system in use is presented.  Finally, it is 
shown how other time-sharing systems may provide similar measuring facilities.

translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  The hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  A computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

to develop an appropriate  <strong style='color:blue;''>hardware</strong>  configuration 
for these systems, but appropriate software adjustments
must be made.  Unfortunately, these systems often 
do not respond to changes in the manner that intuition
would suggest, and there are few guides to assist 
in the analysis of performance characteristics.  The
development of a comprehensive simulation model 
to assist in the investigation of these questions is
described in this paper.  The resulting model has 
a general purpose design and can be used to study a
variety of time-sharing systems.  It can also be 
used to assist in the design and development of new time-sharing
algorithms or techniques.  For the sake 
of efficiency and greater applicability, the model was
implemented in a limited FORTRAN subset that is 
compatible with most FORTRAN IV compilers. The use of
the simulation is demonstrated by a study of the 
IBM 360/67 time-sharing system.

identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material

The "peekaboo" idea from punched card  <strong style='color:blue;''>information</strong> 
retrieval methods has been mated with the 
idea of superimposed punching to produce a programming
technique which cuts computer run time in half 
on a test search of 33,000 subject index entries.  A search
program using the device has been operational 
since late 1963.  As an item is entered in the store,
an 18-byte mask is created from the item's meaningful 
words using the inclusive OR operation.  If, at search
time, the logical product (using the AND operation) 
of this mask and a similarly constructed question mask
is not equal to the question mask, then one or 
more question words are not present in the store item.
 An equality is in conclusive; the words of the 
store item must be unpacked and compared with question
words.  The present store is made up of over 600,000 
subject index entries estimated to average 60 characters
each.  Longer texts, such as abstracts, could 
be handled by multiple masks.

replace the  <strong style='color:blue;''>use of</strong>  the popular secondary index filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
Through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident
hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

Optimal Space Allocation on Disk St <strong style='color:blue;''>or</strong> age Devices

When the amount of space required for file storage
exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line, 
decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently
resident and which mountable.  These decisions 
will affect the number of mount requests issued to the
operators.  This is often a bottleneck in a computing 
facility, and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases
turnaround time.  An optimization model for 
the assignment of files to disk packs, and packs to either
resident or nonresident status is presented. 
 Heuristics are suggested for those cases in which
it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.

the characteristics of various processing languages are
outlined in the light of the procedures requiring

The performance of  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

A Study of St <strong style='color:blue;''>or</strong> age Partitioning Using a Mathematical Model of Locality

Both fixed and dynamic storage partitioning
procedures are examined for use in multiprogramming 
systems.  The storage requirement of programs is modeled
as a stationary Gaussian process.  Experiments 
justifying this model are described.  By means of this
model dynamic storage partitioning is shown to 
provide substantial increases in storage utilization
and operating efficiency over fixed partitioning.

A standard  <strong style='color:blue;''>information retrieval</strong>  operation is
to determine which records in a data collection 
satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values.
 The process of locating the desired responses 
can be represented by a tree search model.  This paper
poses an optimization problem in the design of 
such trees to serve a well-specified application. The
problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily 
the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical
techniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially 
useful for the comparison it affords between observed
performance and that of an intuitively attractive 
ideal search procedure.  As a practical application
of such a model this paper considers the design of 
a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation
of data and shows that essentially the 
same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal
search tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental 
study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.

Dijkstra, Knuth, and others.  Solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal

as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

that text by correctly  <strong style='color:blue;''>relating</strong>  each (explicit or implicit)
assertion of the new text to a large memory. 
 This memory is a "semantic network" representing factual
assertions about the world.  The program also 
creates copies of the parts of its memory which have
been found to relate to the new text, adapting and 
combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text 
the program successfully comprehends is encoded into
the same format as that of the memory.  In this 
form it can be added into the memory.  Both factual
assertions for the memory and the capabilities for 
correctly relating text to the memory's prior content
are to be taught to the program as they are needed. 
 TLC presently contains a relatively small number of
examples of such assertions and capabilities, but 
within the system, notations for expressing either of these
are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds 
to a general process for comprehending language, and
it provides a methodology for adding the additional 
information this process requires to actually comprehend
text of any particular kind.  The memory structure 
and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions
and capabilities for relating text to such 
stored assertions to generalize automatically.  That
is, once such an assertion or capability is put 
into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend
a great many other sentences in the future. 
 Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or
linguistic capability will often provide a large 
increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and
in its overall ability to comprehend text.  The 
program's strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension.

 These include a review of various other control structures,

the importance of one-in, one-out control structures

The algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure

access to a common memory.  Simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.

A  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  processing algorithm for shrinking
binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements, 
one for each pattern, is presented.  This procedure
may be used for counting patterns on a matrix, and 
a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large
scale integrated technology is envisioned.  The 
principal features of this method are the very small
window employed (two-by-two elements), the parallel 
nature of the process, and the possibility of shrinking
any pattern, regardless of the complexity of 
its configuration.  Problems regarding merging and disconnection
of patterns during the process as well 
as the determination of the maximum number of steps
necessary to obtain a single isolated element from 
a pattern, are reviewed and discussed.  An analogy with a
neural network description, in terms of McCulloch-Pitts 
"neurons" is presented.

means for man-machine communication, and software for
static or dynamic graphics display.  The basic 
technique employed is a modified lofting method on
which sectional curves are represented by uniform 
B-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sections
by Cardinal splines.  Among the features of 
this method are algorithms which enable in teractive
modification of the B-spline representation of the 
sectional curves.  At all stages of the process, the
spatial information is graphically displayed to 
the user.  Complex surfaces can be created by the combination
of a number of shapes that have been separately 
generated and automatically joined.  The system has been
successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical

proves that the number of necessary memory accesses

processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

through the developments in  <strong style='color:blue;''>complexity theory</strong> . 
 These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence
on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains 
to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations
can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say 
we have a unified theory.

</p><br/><h1>63) algorithms for parallel computation and especially comparisons between parallel and sequential algorithms </h2><br/><h3>	CACM-2692.html</h3><br/><p>	Polygon Clipping

A new family of clipping  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  is described.
 These algorithms are able to clip polygons 
against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three
dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which 
lie outside the volume.  In two dimensions the algorithms
permit clipping against irregular convex windows. 
 Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered
sequence of vertices without repetition of first 
and last, in marked contrast to representation as a
collection of edges as was heretofore the common 
procedure.  Output polygons have an identical format,
with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe 
any newly-cut edge or edges.  The algorithms easily handle
the particularly difficult problem of detecting 
that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the
clipping window.  The algorithms described achieve 
considerable simplicity by clipping separately against
each clipping plane or window boundary.  Code 
capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary
is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. 
 Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only
two vertex values and may begin its processing 
as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding
stage is ready.  Because the same code is reentered 
for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping
against very complex window shapes is practical. 
 For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane
truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping 
volume.  The two additional planes parallel to the projection
screen serve to limit the range of depth 
preserved through the projection.  A perspective projection
method which provides for arbitrary view 
angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping
planes is described.  This method is ideal 
for subsequent hidden-surface computations.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2402.html</h3><br/><p>	computers encourages the development of  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong> 
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to X-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

a construct which may be added to a list processing system or any
system that handles sets.  It efficiently generates the set which

 <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

</p><br/><h3>	CACM-2851.html</h3><br/><p>	of Parallel Programs

Two formal models  <strong style='color:blue;''>for parallel computation</strong> 
are presented: an abstract conceptual model and 
a parallel-program model.  The former model does not
distinguish between control and data states.  The 
latter model includes the capability for the representation
of an infinite set of control states by allowing 
there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or
processes) executing the program.  An induction 
principle is presented which treats the control and
data state sets on the same ground.  Through the 
use of "place variables," it is observed that certain
correctness conditions can be expressed without 
enumeration of the set of all possible control states.
 Examples are presented in which the induction 
principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion.
 It is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle.
A special case of the assertions method, which 
is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be
incomplete.  A formalization of "deadlock" is then 
presented. The concept of a "norm" is introduced, which
yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, 
of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
and permits shared global variables.  Correctness 
of certain forms of implementation is also discussed.
 An Appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.

It is shown how Wengert's procedure  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  computation
of derivatives can be implemented conveniently 
by use of compiler-generated complex addition, subtraction,
and linkage to complex arithmetic subroutines.
 Evaluation of a function and derivative proceed in

"imaginary" parts of variables declared complex bearing
the values of the derivatives of the real parts. 
 This technique provides a simple way to compute the
derivatives of a function, without the need for 
deriving and programming the evaluation of
explicit formulas for the derivatives.

Two of the algorithms produce the next permutation 
with a single exchange of two marks.  The other two algorithms
infrequently exchange more than two marks, 
but the rules for generating the next permutation are
very simple.  Performance tests which have counted 
execution of assignment statements, comparisons, arithmetic
operations, and subscripted array references 
have shown superiority of the new algorithms compared to
Boothroyd's implementation of M. B. Well's algorithm

Several  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms for</strong>  computation of basic
statistics are compared by their performance on 
systematically generated test data.  The statistics
calculated were the mean, standard deviation and 
correlation coefficient.  For each statistic, the algorithm
included the usual computing formulas, correction 
due to an accumulated error term, and a recursive computation
of the current value of the statistic. 
 The usual computing formulas were also evaluated in
double precision.  Large errors were noted for some 
calculation using the usual computing formulas.  The most
reliable technique was correction of the initial 
estimate by use of an accumulated error term.  To eliminate
the need for making two passes on the data, 
it was suggested that the initial estimate of the
mean be obtained from a subset of the data.

Models  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Parallel Processing WIthin Programs:
Application to CPU:I/O and I/O:I/O Overlap

Approximate queueing models for internal parallel
processing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed 
system are developed in this paper.  The solution technique
is developed by network decomposition.  The 
models are formulated in terms of CPU:I/O and I/O:I/O overlap
and applied to the analysis of these problems. 
 The percentage performance improvement from CPU:I/O
overlap is found to be greatest for systems which 
are in approximate CPU:I/O utilization balance and for
low degrees of multiprogramming.  The percentage 
improvement from I/O:I/O overlap is found to be greatest
for systemtems in which the I/O system is more 
utilized than the CPU.

Four  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms for</strong>  the numerical computation
of the standard deviation of (unweighted) sampled data
are analyzed.  Two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical
and computational literature; the other two are new algorithms
specifically intended for automatic computation.  Our discussion is 
expository, with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of
"accuracy."  Each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions
under which it will be accurate.  We conclude that all four
algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two
of the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate
on difficult problems than are the other two.

Efficient  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  are presented for partitioning

components and simple paths.  The algorithm for partitioning
of a graph into simple paths is iterative 
and each iteration produces a new path between two
vertices already on paths.  (The start vertex can 
be specified dynamically.)  If V is the number of vertices
and E is the number of edges, each algorithm 
requires time and space proportional to max (V,E)

In this report three thinning  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  are
developed: one each for use with rectangular, 
hexagonal, and triangular arrays.  The approach to the
development of each algorithm is the same.  Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.  It is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive 
to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield
a thinned image with an overall reduced number of 
points.  It is concluded that the algorithm operating in
conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.

When proving that a  <strong style='color:blue;''>parallel</strong>  program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible, i.e. that the statement
cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program. 
 Here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that
the assumption that a statement is indivisible 
can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as
halting.  Thus correctness proofs of a parallel 
system can often be greatly simplified.

A Case Study in Programming  <strong style='color:blue;''>for</strong>  Parallel-Processors

An affirmative partial answer is provided to
the question of whether it is possible to program 
parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when N processors are applied approaches
1/N times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

Four  <strong style='color:blue;''>algorithms</strong>  are considered which can be used
to schedule events in a general purpose discrete 
simulation system.  Two of the algorithms are new, one
is based on an end-order tree structure for event 
notices, and another uses an indexed linear list. The algorithms
are tested with a set of typical stochastic 
scheduling distributions especially chosen to show
the advantages and limitations of the algorithms. 
 The end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous,
immediate replacement for the algorithm 
in use with current simulation languages.  The most
promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept. 
 It will require an adaptive routine before it can
be employed in general purpose simulators,but its 
performance is such that further study would be fruitful.

These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The
basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,
and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

Compact  <strong style='color:blue;''>list</strong> s are stored sequentially in memory,
rather than chained with pointers.  Since 
this is not always convenient, the Swym system permits
a list to be chained, compact, or any combination 
of the two.  A description is given of that list representation
and the operators implemented (most are 
similar to those of LISP 1.5).  The system garbage collector
attempts to make all lists compact; it relocates 
and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage.
 This unique list-compacting garbage collection 
algorithm is presented in detail.  Several classes of the
macros used to implement the system are described. 
 Finally, consideration is given to those design factors
essential to the success of a plex processing 
system implementation.

require special linkage conventions.  An execute

 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means

be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors

will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring

The "Plankalkul" of K <strong style='color:blue;''>on</strong> rad Zuse: A Forerunner
of Today's Programming Languages

Plankalkul was an attempt by Korrad Zuse in
the 1940's to devise a notational and conceptual 
system for writing what today is termed a program.  Although
this early approach to a programming language 
did not lead to practical use, the plan is described
here because it contains features that are standard 
in today's programming languages.  The investigation
is of historical interest; also, it may provide 
insights that would lead to advancements in the state
of the art.  Using modern programming terminology, 
the Plankalkul is presented to the extent it has possible
to reconstruct it from the published literature.

PL/I List Processing

The concepts of  <strong style='color:blue;''>list</strong>  processing have been introduced
into the PL/I language.  With these new 
facilities, it is possible to write PL/I procedures that
operate on simple and complex data list organizations. 
 Most list-processing languages have suffered from their
inability to deal directly with complex data 
structures and/or from their inability to perform the
complete range of programming language operations 
upon the data list structures.  These two problems have
been eliminated in the list-processing facilities 
of PL/I.  The basic concepts of list processing and
the philosophy of the PL/I language extensions are 
discussed.  In addition, several detailed list-processing examples are provided.

is to find a transformed digital picture of

 This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered

boxes of assorted sizes, such that the 
accumulated error of space under packed or overpacked
in the boxes is minimized; the placement function 
is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution

and Its Use in Testing for a Chebyshev System

Two recent papers, one by Hansen and one by
Hansen and R. R. Smith, have shown how Interval 
Arithmetic (I.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  In the present paper 
a method proposed by Hasen and R. R. Smith is compared
with straightforward use of I. in determinant 
evaluation.  Computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
I. for determinant evaluation.  An application using
I. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a Chebyshev system is then presented.

 Sm <strong style='color:blue;''>all</strong>  perturbations in the input data resulted in problems
which did not cycle.  This fact, plus several 
other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason
that cycling is not known to occur more frequently 
is the round-off errors in the computations perturb
the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at 
least to prevent indefinite cycling).  In one case maximizing
and minimizing an objective function subject 
to the same constrain t set was attempted, but MPS solved
only one of these while giving an indication 
of infeasibility for the other.
